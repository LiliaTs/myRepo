"Not much to write about here, but it does exactly what it's supposed to. filters out the pop sounds. now my recordings are much more crisp. it is one of the lowest prices pop filters on amazon so might as well buy it, they honestly work the same despite their pricing,",Positive
"The product does exactly as it should and is quite affordable.I did not realized it was double screened until it arrived, so it was even better than I had expected.As an added bonus, one of the screens carries a small hint of the smell of an old grape candy I used to buy, so for reminiscent's sake, I cannot stop putting the pop filter next to my nose and smelling it after recording. :DIf you needed a pop filter, this will work just as well as the expensive ones, and it may even come with a pleasing aroma like mine did!Buy this product! :]",Positive
"The primary job of this device is to block the breath that would otherwise produce a popping sound, while allowing your voice to pass through with no noticeable reduction of volume or high frequencies. The double cloth filter blocks the pops and lets the voice through with no coloration. The metal clamp mount attaches to the mike stand secure enough to keep it attached. The goose neck needs a little coaxing to stay where you put it.",Positive
Nice windscreen protects my MXL mic and prevents pops. Only thing is that the gooseneck is only marginally able to hold the screen in position and requires careful positioning of the clamp to avoid sagging.,Positive
This pop filter is great. It looks and performs like a studio filter. If you're recording vocals this will eliminate the pops that gets recorded when you sing.,Positive
"So good that I bought another one.  Love the heavy cord and gold connectors.  Bass sounds great.  I just learned last night how to coil them up.  I guess I should read instructions more carefully.  But no harm done, still works great!",Positive
"I have used monster cables for years, and with good reason. The lifetime warranty is worth the price alone. Simple fact: cables break, but getting to replace them at no cost is where it's at.",Positive
Perfect for my Epiphone Sheraton II.  Monster cables are well constructed.  I have several and never had any problems with any of them over the years.  Got this one because I wanted the 90 degree plug.,Positive
Monster makes the best cables and a lifetime warranty doesnt hurt either. This isnt their top of the line series but it works great with my bass guitar rig and has for some time. You cant go wrong with Monster Cables.,Positive
"Monster makes a wide array of cables, including some that are very high end. I initially purchased a pair ofMonster Rock Instrument Cable - 21 Feet - Angled to Straight 1/4-Inch plugto use with my keyboards, but when it came time to purchase cables for my bass and guitar I thought I'd pinch a few pennies.  I am so glad I did.I compared this cable model to the more expensive models I previously purchased and, aside from looks, could not detect any difference in sound. I Swapped back and forth between my guitars and keyboards, ensuring that each model was used on each instrument - still no difference.What the more expensive model has going for it is looks. I am not sure it (the higher priced model) is even more sturdy because the molded stress relief ends on this model seem to make it more reliable than its pricier sibling.Bottom line: carefully compare both cables using your own instrument and amp - if possible - before making a purchase decision. You may find, as I did, that higher price does not necessarily equal higher value, even from the same manufacturer.",Positive
I got it to have it if I needed it. I have found that i don't really need it that often and rarely use it. If I was really good I can see the need. But this is a keyboard not an organ.,Positive
"I love it, I used this for my Yamaha ypt-230 and it works great, I would recommend it to anyone",Positive
I bought this to use in my home studio to control my midi keyboard. It does just what I wanted it to do.,Positive
"This Fender cable is the perfect length for me! Sometimes I find it a bit too long but I don't mind. The build quality is great and I know that it will last. The only gripe I have with this cable is that the metal sleeve gets unscrewed way too easily, requiring me to tighten it often.Sound quality is not affected, and the color is cool, definitely try this cable out.",Positive
wanted it just on looks alone...It is a nice looking cord... I know it will perform...as for Sam Ash ...this cord was packed in a mailer inside another box with my Roc n Soc... his shipping team do great work..never any complaints from me... I love Sam Ash.. thanks Amazon,Positive
"I've been using these cables for more than 4 months and they are holding up pretty well.  For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-",Positive
Fender cords look great and work just as well. By adding the word California to the description I'm sure to sound like the Beach Boys...,Positive
"This is a cool looking cheap cable which works well. I bent one of the connectors pretty badly but that was my fault. One thing to consider with the cable is to tighten the connectors once in awhile. You'll be able to hear them rattle. It seems that the 'retro' look is screw on connectors over some black rubber, but other than that, the cable looks cool and works well.I also have the shorter red cable which goes with one of my guitars perfectly. I bought theses to use while practicing with others who use black cables. It's easier to plug into different amps without cutting someone out by accident. The green cable is good for that.",Positive
The Fender 18 Feet California Clear Instrument Cable - Lake Placid Blue  is a very good extra cord for a good price.,Positive
Very good cable. Well made and it looks great with my Candy Apple Red Tele. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because it tends not to lay flat on the floor.,Positive
"Got this cable to run a rockband keyboard controller to my M-audio profire 2626 to control midi in Pro Tools. Works great! Firm fit, solidly molded ends, reputable branded cable.(a bit on the thin side, but i haven't seen to have any issue due to this or anything. Couldn't go wrong for $5 at the time of my purchase and prime eligibility.",Positive
"When I was searching for MIDI cables for my ART X-15 foot controller, I came across these Hosa ones, and they were $2 dollars each! As they are now $6, I realize I would still be happy with that price as well, as they are high quality plastic and metal connectors, and work flawlessly. You must realize that they are only 5 feet, as I overestimated it and now wish they were longer. For any connection from racked sound modules, this will be perfect.",Positive
Cant go wrong. Great quality on a budget price  - Hosa is the go to when you need to hook things up,Positive
"The ends of the midi cable look and feel like quality. Connection is secure, no worries about uneven connections, it also detaches without a hitch. Highly recommended.",Positive
"Just trying to find a midi to midi was a task, and you have to make sure the pin config is correct.  This one is a good product and works just fine",Positive
The Hosa XLR cables are affordable and very heavily made.I have a large mixer and rack and cables everywhere.I decided to purchase shorter cables and the Hosa cables 5ft measurement worked perfectly.You really will not be disappointed with these.,Positive
I bought these to go from my board to the amp. We use them for a mobile church so they take a beating. They are still going strong.,Positive
"Sturdy cord and plugs, inexpensive, good value. I don't require professional-level equipment, so this cord serves my purposes well. Satisfied with purchase.",Positive
"Use it every week at gigs.  Solid, no problems with the solder joints.  A good quality cable at a very good price.",Positive
"Hosa products are a good bang for the buck. I haven't looked up the specifications, but I'm guessing the wire is 22 to 24 AWG, but since it's only 10' long, it's good enough.",Positive
This was exactly what I was after. I have a voice touch and needed a small cord to connect the mic to the voice touch and this was perfect. Before I used a 20 foot cord to go about 12 inches. I highly recommend this for those who keep the mic on a stand and have a voice touch or other stand connected device for vocals.,Positive
I bought these because I really had too long of mike cords for my solo live show. And these are really nice cords if you have a home portastudio recording studio like myself. Who needs all the spaghetti to trip on all over the place? I bought two because I use a Digitech Live 2 Harmony processor and two XLR mike cords are required to make it operational. Good price here too. Hard to find just 10' mike cords. Usually longer ones are only obtainable.,Positive
This cable seems like it will last me for a while. As it is only being used to connect a DI box it will not get abused as much as the vocal mics always do.,Positive
"These are not the greatest but they're cheap and they get to you fast when you need them. I've only had one fail and I've bought many of them to use in our broadcast studio.Amazon is the first place I go when I need cables for audio, video, computers or concert lighting.Good music to all!",Positive
"This is a fine cable at a decent price point, nothing exceptional mind, but it gets the job done well enough.",Positive
"I've used a lot of cables and I always come back to HOSA, they are indeed some of the best audio cables in their price range on the market.",Positive
"I bought this cord after returning a cheap one that I should've known better than to buy. My son, who has some experience as a musician recommended the Hosa brand when I was seeking a proper replacement.I bought it for a small home recording setup which includes a Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Behringer Xenyx 302 Mixer, and both ends make a reliable connection to both the board and the mic; the sound quality is excellent.An excellent value for the money.",Positive
"Nice solid cables, with excellent support at the ends.  Should last a lifetime of usage no problem and just what I needed to connect my tube preamp.",Positive
Good quality cable and sounds very good,Positive
"Zero issues with this cable so far.  It feels fairly cheap and light weight but it has survived for months of plugging in, unplugging, and packing between practice spaces.I'll update this review if/when it breaks.",Positive
Realtively inexpensive patch cable for electric guitar.I have had it for a few months and so far it has held up pretty well,Positive
"I bought this because I wanted a cheap replacement cable for one that had a short. I'm pleasantly surprised with this cable. It's decent sound and decent build quality, for a good price.",Positive
"This is a very nice cable for the price. I already bent one end of it though, fortunately it still works fine. Inside the phono connector the wires are covered by white shrink plastic. Haven't noticed any hum or crackles. For sure a good buy.",Positive
Cheap and good texture rubber that does not get stiff.  Only time will tell how well the soldering is.  Sounds fine to me.,Positive
"Seems sturdy enough, and no noise issues, so I'm pretty much satified with it; it doesn't leave the house so I'm not asking it to handle a lot, but with reasonable care it should last a while.",Positive
"I'm not a professional, but have been playing for many, many years.  This is the best cord I've ever had, though I'm sure Eric Clapton has something better.",Positive
"This Hosa Cable is very well made, with good quality connectors and a nice long length. My son is expanding his collection of amps and effects pedals so needed additional cables to get everything connected. This 25' cable gives him flexibility to move around and it is sturdy enough that it can take being stepped on and pulled around.The cable works well and is a good value for a decent quality cable.Highly Recommended!CFH",Positive
"Bought this for my daughter along with her new guitar. It seems to work well, no issues in the first couple of weeks.",Positive
"I am not hard on cables.  I typically just plug them in to my guitar, dont move around much, and play for an hour or two a day.  this one seem to perform just fine.  no buzz, and/or other noises noted.  I have several of them and they have all performed well.",Positive
"I have found Hosa cables to be an excellent value. More expensive cables may be more rugged, but for the price, I'm very happy with the Hosa's I have purchased.",Positive
"This is good cable. Excellent 1/4&#34; plugs. The lugs and solder joints are covered with heat shrink material, which will hold everything in place for years. Grade A+ cable at a very affordable price. Definitely  going back for more. The 25 ft. cable was only a couple dollars more than 10 ft.",Positive
"Pretty crappy cable. It works and gets the job done, but after purchasing this product and using it, I will shell out the extra bucks for better quality.",Positive
I use this cord in my church to run from my pedalboard to my amp (which is in a soundproof box). The cord is reliable and clean sounding. I like it and have used HOSA products in the past with confidence. Excellent cord. Hopefully this review will be usefull to you.,Positive
"This my second Hosa guitar cable.  (The other one is shorter.)  Like my first Hosa cable, this is a high quality item.  I'd definitely buy more cables of this brand.",Positive
"These cables have taken a beating the last few months, and have served me well with no problems..Real metal ends, not molded on, with high quality silicone jackets and strain reliefs at the connectors..",Positive
In my opinion it does not hurt to have extra guitar cables around. From experience they tend to just die without notice. I have a feeling this one will last a long time. It is built sturdy and sounds really good.I recommend this product.,Positive
Hosa guitar cables work great. Never had any problems with them. I own several of different lengths and they all sound perfect.,Positive
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do at a decent price.  I have absolutely no complaints.  This is my first experience with the brand and I am not disappointed.,Positive
"Good quality guitar cord.Very low noise, repairable, effective strain releaf,thick rubber cover!! This is a great buy, under 10 bucks for a quality cord.Of course I just got it..it might not be durable but it looks durable.If I change my mind about anything I will update my review.For now, I would say, buy one!!Joe",Positive
"This is a good solid cable with no problems. When I'm on stage, I like a longer cable but at practice I don't need all the extra length tangleing up on everything...",Positive
This guitar cable is very nice.  It looks high quality and has the white ends.  Fantastic deal for this cable.,Positive
Good product at a good price. Have used it multiple times and works well with my guitar and speaker. Great to have when friends come over to jam.,Positive
This item is well built and I like the terminal ends and how they have the spring built in. These aren't going to be the most durable road cables but for home and light road use they will work well.,Positive
This amp plug is great for the price its 10 ft long the perfect size for jammin at home and it has a quality look to it aesthetically totally worth the price,Positive
"Hosa Cable GTR210 Guitar Instrument Cable - 10ft. is a High quality Instrument Cable, but low cost, won't break the bank. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",Positive
"This is your basic, black electric guitar cable but it works great.  So far the connections at both ends are solid and the sound from the amp is great!  Nice and rubbery and 10 feet is long enough.  If problems arise later with this cable, I will update this review, but as of now there has been no problems whatsoever with this cable.",Positive
"Hosa cable quality can be all over the place, some of their products are good (sound good, reliable, long lasting) and some of their products are not good (affect sound negatively, break prematurely, short useful life span).These guitar cords are actually quite nice, they feel good (gooey soft rubber jacket like Mogami), they sound good and so far they are working reliably, the rubber jacket is about .25&#34; in diameter (by eye) and there is a short heat shrink overwrap to add strength where the wire enters the plug.I bought these when I needed cables fast for an internet concert, we had lots of pedals and signal splits to connect up. These cables arrived in good working condition and we've been using them continuously since.We have over a dozen tube amps and are very particular about sound degradation but so far these cables have not disappointed anyone.I would buy more if I needed them.",Positive
"I never really considered a cheaper cable, I was always taught to get the best I could afford. When this showed up in a cable search on amazon, I jumped on it. I figured I had nothing to lose.To my surprise, this is an excellent cable, with good build quality and a strong, thick jacket that inspires confidence. The sound through it is identical to my Monster cables, and it cost one quarter the price....hmmmm, guess I should have tried to figure this out myself instead of listening to &#34;snobs&#34; for so many years. I will never do that again.This is worth the money twice over, try it out for yourself and kiss overpriced cables goodbye!",Positive
"For the price, fantastic.They do feel light and I don't trust the build quality at the key stress points (where cable meets connector), but then again I am not going to push it.Set your guitar down on it by accident when it's plugged in and...who knows.But for seven bucks it gets the job done. Recommended if you are doing the ""beginner"" thing and testing the waters.Otherwise, spend a few more bucks for something with higher chances of lasting.",Positive
"Hosa makes good stuff, this is no exception. I've trusted them for years, I can't think if a single Hosa cable I've owned that's failed.",Positive
Only complaint is the size which is my fault. If you can buy at least a 15 foot if you plan to use it on stage.,Positive
"Hard to day too much, but it works great. No issues to speak of. It does the job perfectly well",Positive
"For the price, this works really well. I see no faults. It can unscrew pretty easily, but this is hardly a problem right now.",Positive
"This cable disproves the notion that you get what you pay for. It's quality outweighs its price. Let's face it, a cable is a cable is a cable. But the quality of these cables can vary greatly. I replaced a lighter cable with this one and I was surprised at the difference in the quality of the sound from my amp. I have an Ibanez ART series guitar into an Ibanez 15 watt amp set up in my home. With nothing changed but the cable, there was a significant difference in quality and volume. So much so that I checked with my guitar teacher who said he was not surprised. The quality appears good. The ends are heavy duty and the little bit of hum I had due to the proximity of everything was attenuated to the point where it was inconsequential. I've seen more expensive cables and this one is (so far) great.Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft",Positive
I was looking for a long cable to perform live with my band and i'm glad with HOSA quality. It feels reliable and without adding noise.,Positive
"These are Good cables at a good price!! Not sure they would hold up to heavy use, but for practicing at home they are really great!",Positive
"very sturdy, high quality with little to no feedback, i use it for performing for my friends and they all love it",Positive
"Unless you're going to go for the very top of the line most expensive professional chords, these will do for any medium sized venue.",Positive
"I have many lengths of these Hosa cables and have neverhad a problem with them.I am not an active musician, so have not put any of them throughthe riggers of what happens on stage; so I cannot comment on thistype of usage.In my over 40 years (10 of them on stage) I have come to realize, thatyou should ALWAYS have extra cables (just like strings) with you, aseven the most expensive cables will sometimes let you down.",Positive
"I've been using these for about 3 weeks now - they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending ""habits"" if you roll them up the proper way.I've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point.  And I've certainly seen quite a few worse!  This is a pretty good sweet spot, in my opinion.",Positive
Works great on my 100 watt Amp. Almost compares to a monster cable. And with Its length Its plenty of Room from your Guitar to amp. GOOD PRODUCT!,Positive
"Good cable, as good as any expensive brand. Thick, a bit stiff and seems to be shielded. No complaints at all.",Positive
"I own lots of hosa cables they are cheap and quality is there. I've only recieved one bad cable out of around 50 or so. I use a lot of these guys and if they work when you get them, they havn't failed yet.",Positive
the cable is great for connecting directly to the computer microphone to record live without a console or mixer...... its great  i recomended,Positive
Bought this to hook up a Beta 58 to a Panasonic G2 DSLR and a Kodak Zi8 for interviews. Works the way it's supposed to. 90 degree TRS is a nice touch. Good price.,Positive
"Just received this cord and it seems to work as expected. What can you say about an adapter cord?  It is well made, good construction and sound from my DSLR with my mic is superb.",Positive
"If you're like me, you probably bought this to hook up an XLR microphone to a digital recorder or a PC.It works fine for the handy type recorders.But forget hooking this directly to a PC.  Way too much noise.",Positive
"Well made, XLR 3 pin adaptor to mini.  Needed to get a real XLR mic into the computer and this did the job.",Positive
"The listing for this item can be confusing if you are not sure what stereo XLR is.  Stereo XLR is meant to be similar to your stereo headphones, where left and right are separate unbalanced wires.  This cable is configured to be a stereo unbalanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced TRS cable.  This item is not a mono balanced XLR to a stereo unbalanced mic cable.A little bit a soldering can fix this connector by moving the red wire from ping #3 to pin #2 with the white wire.  Pin #3 then ties to pin #1 with the ground wire.",Positive
"First, the reasons why I awarded this five stars: the construction is uniformly excellent. Both ends have strain reliefs, the 1/8"" connecter perfectly mates with the plug into which I insert it, and the XLR end is a quality component.I purchased this specifically to transform the third channels in myPowerwerks 50 Watt Personal P.A. Systeminto something more useable. This greatly expands the functionality and versatility of the portable PA by allowing me to plug in another mic. Since I have three of those units daisychained I was able to significantly enhance the entire system with this simple adapter.Another reason why I love this is it's noise free. In some environments in which I play there are sources of electromagnetic interference that cheap cables will pick up and transmit. I have not had that problem with this one, so it's another plus.Overall I am very pleased with this adapter and actually purchased a spare in case I damage or lose my primary one. It's a bit pricier than others I considered, but I feel that the quality and peace of mind are worth the premium.",Positive
I use this cable to run a extra line from microphone podiums to a zoom H1. This adapter has never failed me and has been instrumental in capturing quality audio at live events. I own several of these and love them.I highly recommend this adapter to any visual or audio professional. Also check out Hosa's sinlge XLR to double XLR splitter.,Positive
"This adapter cable for stereo mics to work with small DV cameras will function but with caveats.First, it's construction is pretty light weight. That means you will have to be ""gentle"" with it when using it. That's something none of us in the broadcast production field want to worry about since our gear gets pretty beat up.Second, the adapter only has a one foot in length cable on it. This is pretty short and may not reach to wherever the mic input jack is on your camera. That means you would need another short XLR mic cable to extend from the mic to this adapter.So just be aware that this may work fine for some and not work at all for others. I went to Sam Ash music and found a similar adapter cable, heavy duty, and with a longer cable for the same price. It pays to shop around!",Positive
"Well made. Works as it should. However, seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800. (more than the usual expected)To see if it was the Mic, cable, or adapter; Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorder.Seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR input.No big surprises. Minor clean up in post.",Positive
"Haven't used it yet but if it's like the other cables I have from the same company, it should work fine.",Positive
Great stereo sound out of the keyboards.My keys had a single 1/4&#34; stereo out so this cable was needed to get it to convert to a true 2 channel stereo so we could EQ it properly and it worked like a charm. I highly recommend this cable.,Positive
Another quality product from Hosa.  Just what I needed for an insert patch from my mixer to EQ.  I always like slightly longer length as I can always zip tie back but hard to stretch!  No noise from this cable!,Positive
"When I ordered these I wasn't expecting a whole lot since the price was under two dollars for a nearly 10-foot cable.  It turns out the quality is quite excellent and these cables are not flimsy at all.  I plugged them into the mixer and waited to hear some static, interference or buzz to explain the low price and all I got was a nice, clean signal.  Highly recommend these to anyone with a mixer that needs an insert cable.",Positive
"These are solid cables -- tight fit in receptacles, no introduction of noise, and no discernible loss of signal. Especially considering the price, these are brilliant. I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good, but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren't sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable, and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices.",Positive
"On my mixer, I have send/returns on the same plug using a 3 wire TRS with send on the tip, return on the ring, and a common ground.  But my effects boxes like to have separate 1/4"" TR ins and outs.This is the perfect cable for just such a hookup of things like the behringer sharkBehringer Shark FBQ100 Automatic Feedback Destroyerto the 1202-vlZ3's send/returnsMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-Ch. Compact Recording/SR MixerI probably will order a second cable having seen how well the first one worked out on a send/return.",Positive
"I still operate in an analog environment quite often, so I end up using lots of inserts. I have 8 channels of compression, limiter, gate and expander, plus various EQs and effects processors that need to be routed and applied to specific channels. I have an insert snake that I use as well, but the individual insert cables (of differing lengths) that I carry are lifesavers that make me a more efficient soundman during setup and a more flexible soundman during the show!",Positive
"I use these in my home studio as INSERTS and they work great. No complaints.On a side note, I always clean all my cables with CAIG DeoxIT Gold G5 Spray Contact Conditioner 5 oz.and hightly recommend it to all musicians, you will hear the differnce. I also spray a q-tip and and clean all the jacks on my guitars and instruments.",Positive
"When you need an audio insert cable, you need an audio insert cable.We custom manufacture insert cables for custom sound-reinforcement fixed installations.  For  mobile rigs, such as mixer cases with processing gear, it's simply not cost effective, and Hosa is our go-to brand for reliability and durability.  There are other brands, but our reputation is at stake.Hosa allows us to maintain our good reputation, while lowering our labor costs. Thanks for such a dependable product, Hosa!  Thanks for such a great price, Amazon!",Positive
I play my I-pod through a small guitar Amp.  Great way to wake up the kids.  Works perfectly for the purpose.  Keep in mind small end for I-Pod is stereo and large end that goes into amp in mono.  If needing a stereo jack at both ends get something else.,Positive
plugged it in and it works to connect a mono line out to the stereo input on a Lepai amp. not much else I can tell you,Positive
"I bought a few of these to hook iPods/iPhones to live stage sound systems, most of which are not in stereo anyway, so why use stereo-to-mono adapters or 2 separate channels when it's not needed? Perfect solution, seems durable.",Positive
"I carry this in my bass gig bag so I can plug my phone into the mono aux-input on the back of my Genz Benz bass head. Handy for rehearsals when the band needs to listen to a track while working out an arrangement (my bass cab is full range fEARful 15/6/1). Before picking this up, I used a couple of cables / adapters to go from stereo 1/8&#34;  to mono 1/4&#34; and it often seemed I never had quite what I needed on hand.",Positive
"This is what it is... A super cheap mono cable. It should be sufficient for many needs and is cheap enough that thin wire gauge and such can be forgiven. Just be aware that it is cheap and unshielded, etc.For the price and intent, I almost gave it 5 stars. But it's not a 5-star cable... It's a fair quality ultra cheap cable. 4 stars seems about right. (Yes, this is almost exactly what I wrote about the other Hosa cable I reviewed.)",Positive
"It's hard not to love a cord that carries electrons all the way to the end. Not sure what, other than complete failure would take stars away.",Positive
"Cables are cables. They usually all work. And with Amazon, you will always find the best deals for the same quality.",Positive
"Picked up a cable to test on my new pedalboard, and I couldn't be happier. Doesn't suck tone, cables are sturdy, and they sound great. This replaced a normal straight 1/4 inch cable and saves so much space on my board.",Positive
"This L Jack is good enough to make connections between my guitar pedals and it works fine. Flexible enough. I don't like only the fact that it's made out of plastic and it looks cheap, but for the price i paid for it i don't really care.",Positive
"These little patch cables work nicely, there's no change to your tone or sound and they connect one pedal to another just fine..I'm only going to make one small complaint and explain why it got 4 stars instead of 5. The product description says 6 inches, right? If you jump over to these (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PGXKC8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) planet waves patch cables they're listed at .5 feet (same as 6 inches, right?) The Hosa cables seem more like maybe 4 inches, whereas the planet waves cables gave me plenty of room from one pedal to another. I only used the Hosa cable as an emergency back up.To conclude, would I recommend these? Yes, if you have one or two pedals and need an affordable small and effective patch cable, go for these. But my first recommendation will always be planet waves cables over anything else.",Positive
"If you need some 6"" cables to connect your pedals, look no farther. These cables are perfect. They deliver good sound, are very small, and very cheap. What more could you ask for?!",Positive
Bought this Hosa Pedal Cable for our son to interconnect his guitar pedal. It works well and seems to be durable. It hasn't given him any problems so far. It doesn't appear to change the sound quality or tone. Great product.,Positive
"Good little connector cable.  Well constructed, durable, built to last.  I would recommend this cable to connect stomp boxes. Worth it.",Positive
"These are great cables. The only con I could give is if they go bad...no opening up the ends to fix them, but in my experience they are durable. Most people are using these on a pedal board so there's not a lot of movement to wear them down.",Positive
"Works just fine, great for little spaces between one pedal to another, if there's more distance, better use another type, bue generally works fine and it's a good quality product, clean signal no problems",Positive
"exactly what I needed to connect 2 distortion paddles to my amp...do yourself a favor, always order threw Amazon dealers! I placed an order threw onlinecarstereo.com and had to report a scam operation to my credit card co....their customer reviews were terrible, yet I made the mistake of placing n order...right before my eyes they changed their BAD reviews to add good ones....",Positive
These are great patch cables especially for the price. They don't suck any tone they are reliable(I've had mine for 2 years)and are really great for players on a budget.,Positive
"these cable came super fast in the mail, They deliver the level of performance you would expect form low cost cables. they work",Positive
This is a very good cable. I don't forsee having any problems with it. It's just right for hooking my pedals together eithout the mesws of long cables. If you need this get it. The price is right and shipping was right on time.,Positive
"This is not the fanciest cable you can buy, but it fits my low budget.  It works perfectly, it doesn't feel like its going to break anytime soon, and my pedals are perfectly connected.",Positive
I typically use planet waves cables but tried these and there just as great. Never an issue. No loss of tone. Never breaks or fails. Quality product for a good price.,Positive
"Really just some inexpensive and yet durable cables to link your stompboxes together. As of yet, i havent had one go all crackly, which, considering they get frequent use, is pretty good. Often, cheap cords die within a year or so. Every electric guitarist keeps a stock of these things, and this one in particular is cheap and accessible. I probably have around twelve of them.Enjoy!",Positive
Hosa patch cables are the best for the buck. Great sound and flexible. I'm a firm Hosa cable fan. Love these little guys.,Positive
These have a lower profile and can fit and bend into the places the ones with thick metal ends can't.,Positive
"I bought 6 of these XLR to 1/4&#34; adapters hoping to connect my microphones to an old funky mixer I owned with 1/4&#34; inputs.  It didn't end up working because I discovered I needed to convert the microphone level to line level (which these don't do), however they do convert XLR to 1/4&#34; balanced quite well.  Just not what I needed in my particular situation.",Positive
"I use this adapter on the interface/mix board end of 1 channel of my XLR cable snake, to change 1 channel into my monitor return. I plug an XLR to Female 1/4"" stereo adapter to the other end to create a headphone jack at the musician end of my setup. Now I can record with 6 channels, and monitor with 2. (It's an 8 channel XLR snake). Why do I go through all that you ask? because I have an 8 channel XLR snake, and instead of buying another snake, why not ADAPT the snake I have? hence the word adapter... :-P I love it. It's a great tool to add versatility to your setup, no matter what you're doing. Definately recommend this product to anyone that would happen to need to change an XLR to balanced 1/4"" stereo... It's high quality, and very solid, I definately expect this to last me a long time.",Positive
"I purchased this to work with my ION system and my shure mic. Arrived as expected, very solid great fit. It works!!!!",Positive
This has come in handy many times in my studio Z108.net. We love having it around. Good quality affordable price.,Positive
"As the title says, it works.  The only reason I took off a star is sometimes it gets a little stuck and I have to use some force to get it off the XLR.  But, no issues besides that.",Positive
"This converts an xlr signal (for me, a Shure SM57 mic) into a 1/4 male (I run it into a guitar pedalboard and then an amp).  Have no issues with performance but the converter is a little bulky especially once you clip a mic onto that.  Could be tight fitting into certain places on a pedalboard but works great overall.",Positive
Its affordable and it works.  Its a nice little adapter for your low impedance cable to your high impedance input.,Positive
"For the price, can't beat it.  Works as well as any $15 - $20 one I would have bought at local guitar stores.",Positive
Just a basic female XLR to 1/4 inch male adapter. I use these so I can plug my regular mic cables into my keyboard/practice all in one PA.,Positive
"I bought this XLR splitter to split the lead vocal from FOH to my monitor rack.  Used this way it worked great and I never had any problems with signal loss or power issues.  I began using a transformer isolated XLR splitter after we started playing bigger venues and no longer use this splitter.  My only issue with the Hosa Y splitter is that the cable length from the female connector to the male connectors is very short, so short that it would cause the microphone cables to stick out from the mic stand when I plugged it into our lead singer's microphone.  It would be great on a guitar mic or something that's close to the ground, or horizontally placed, but it looks a little funny coming off of a vertical microphone stand.",Positive
As expected from Hosa another great product.  Solid construction and great sound reproduced.  i would recomed this product to everyone.,Positive
"I use this to run a single, mono XLR shotgun mic line to two audio channels on my Tascam DR-40, which saves me a step in post-production.  The quality is fine and it does what it's supposed to do.  Good price for a good product.",Positive
"If I didn't think that purchasing these items from Amazon I wouldn't do it, plus and more important I have worked as a Purchasing Coordinator for over 25 years now I know how to save money and if purchasing that are great and believe me or not I can find even cables that I can't find in RadioShack, Best Buys no where else, I have done a lot of Purchasing not just for myself, but for business. These Ladies and Gentlemen know what they are doing and they know how to take care of business in the right way, I would like to apply for a position with them.Regards,ffsalsa",Positive
"This is a solid product. I ended up not needing it so... I returned it. However, it worked fine and gets the job done.",Positive
"This Dual splitter works perfect. I own a live event video company and I shoot a lot of weddings. The most important part of video is the audio. you can make anything look good as long as you can get a good clean audio signal. I always say, half of video is audio. For years I used to run a line directly out of the DJ's mixer to get my audio. The issue with doing it that way is during introdustions you will get the music the dj is playing and the words they are speaking. Often though, the signal is to hot, the music is crap, or the dj says something stupid. With just the DJ's voice I can edit the way I want and compress time. This product has improved my productions beyond it's price sold. I use them to run a separate clean audio line from a DJ's wireless systems to my own audio recorder. They work perfectly and haven't failed me once.",Positive
"This was recommended to me by the top engineer at Genz-Benz bass amplification company.  Andy said that this product is far superior to any other.  He was right.  Fixed the scratchy potentiometer on my Shuttle 6.0 amp.  Also fixed the effects loop jacks, which had become oxidized and were causing my amp to intermittently lose 90% of its power on gigs.  Not good!  After several gigs worth of testing, both problems are resolved!  Andy said that this product actually works better over time once it has been applied since it has a lubricating, cleaning and coating effect on the components.  Wow!  And no, Andy does not own stock in, have affiliation with, or represent in any way the manufacturers of De-Oxit.  Nor do I.",Positive
"This thing is like a magic Spray! Hah!Seriously... I used this on noisy hinges, car doors, etc.I really bought it to clean the POTs (volume controls and knobs) on my Guitars, pedals and equipment. It really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example.",Positive
"I bought this product to use on my amp pots. It restored the sound,power and clearity of my amps.It doesn't evaporate right away, but after a couple of minutes your good to go!",Positive
"Before you pay some tech to fix the knobs and switches on your guitar, stomp box or amp, try this.  95% of the time, this will take care of the problem.  If your amp cuts in and out, also try spraying the effects loop and pushing a 1/4&#34; jack in and out of the socket a dozen times.  The very first can I bought probably paid for itself a hundred times over.  Good stuff !",Positive
"I deal with quite a bit of electronic musical instrument gear from guitars, basses, amps, FX, MIDI gear, etc.  Over time most of it starts suffering from scratchy / noisy pots (knobs), input and output jacks that are crackly, etc.In the past I've tried some Locktite electronics cleaner, which is provided in a similar can. It would rarely work.In contrast this has cleaned every piece of gear I've used it on saving me from having to physically replace the pots and jacks. It's really like magic in a can.",Positive
I was getting errors that my printer cartridge wasn't recognized and I sprayed some on the contacts and wiped off the excess with a paper towel.  Now it's working!,Positive
"This stuff works great and is well worth the price, I used it to clean the pots on several guitars and a bass amp along with various effect pedals, no more scratchiness, no more jarring volume spikes, all my knobs glide now better than the day they were new, I'll always keep a can of this around, nothing more to say, great stuff.",Positive
Fantastic stuff....I sprayed it in my bass guitar's pot and now its like new. Wish I had found this stuff sooner.,Positive
"What was it, brillcream? a dab will do ya?Something like that -This is all you need for contact cleaning. Worth the coin.",Positive
"I used this on my guitar Tone and Volume pots and it clears up the crackle.Feels a little oily, but gets the job done and you don't have to replacethe potentiometers.",Positive
Use this alot on all kinds of electronics. It gets crackling knobs going again. I've use it for years. recommend,Positive
"The pots on my bass has become &#34;scratchy&#34; so I sprayed a bit into them, turn the pots back and forth a few times and no more noise. Great for what I needed.",Positive
"For the money, this karaoke mic does a decent job for any vocal use. Good to keep as a spare in the gig box.",Positive
"i was truly surprised when i saw how nice it was, has weight to it ,and has good sound , looks nicely made,very good deal for the money,,can't go wrong,, (not a very cheep made microphone ,, MUCH BETTER THEN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE ! ) its nice,",Positive
"The only reason I give 4 stars is because I ordered 2 of these and 1 had the chord with it and one was missing the chord... I ordered both at the same time, other than that they are good hot mics...",Positive
"We bought this Mic and a spare for our son's guitar amp set-up for his mixer. It seems to work fine, and comes with the Mic cord, We decided to go for the model with the on=off switch based on other reviews, and haven't yet been disappointed.",Positive
"As a freelancer, I occasionally work with a band that plays the Midwest, performing on a near-weekly basis.  These are seasoned veterans who have no interest in gear per se and even less interest in brand cachet.  It's all about money to them.  I couldn't believe it when I first saw the group using these Nady mics (even lower-priced several years ago) and insisting they were as good as Shure SM-57's and 58's.  I still don't believe the quality of workmanship compares (any casual empirical test of build quality will prove as much).  But these Nady's handle the announcing, the vocals, and, when needed, the softer sounding instruments (flute, harmonica), and none has broken or quit on my watch.I'm a keyboardist, so mic power and fidelity don't affect me.  I'm only a trifle mortified when there are musicians in the audience who catch on to how cheap we are when it comes to the all-important ""gear component.""  At the same time, my embarrassment, I confess, is not unmixed with a bit of demonic glee.  After all, who's playing--and getting paid for it?",Positive
We bought this mic after seeing how our grandson was handling the mic that came with the karaoke machine thinking that mic would not last very long.  I hope it does because this nady sp-4c is a very impressive mic for the price.  We our using it with our Roland cm30 cube and plan to use it with a Roland micro cube also.  I would have given it 5 stars if the cord connection to the mic was not a little loose.,Positive
"I bought this cable for my band's live show setup.  I bought it almost a year ago and still currently use it for the same application.  While not the best quality cable, the length and price make it a good value for the money, especially if you're buying several at a time.  I don't use these cables in the studio but for live, they're fine.  I'd recommend this cable if you're on a budget and looking to buy several at a time.  If you're only going to buy one, I'd look into Canare or Mogami, they're a little bit more expensive but easy to get and worth the price.",Positive
If they're used for live performances they will not last very long! Good for the price. I need to resolder the ends after a concert though.,Positive
"There's nothing complicated about this purchase. It's a cable. It works. It doesn't cost a lot. It's a great deal. Get it.I use it every week, and it still sounds perfect. Then, again, I never mistreat my equipment.",Positive
"I bought this cable in order to be able to run longer cable runs on stage. It works for that. It's a narrower gauge of wire than some of my other cables, and that makes me a little cagy about its durability. I tend to use it for cable runs where I don't expect a lot of movement (e.g., running a cable to a mic stand) and save my better cables for the belt pack mics.The jacket on the cable has a very pronounced butyl rubber smell, and it really activated my allergies at first. I stored the mic cables in an open cardboard box for a few months before using them, and that seemed to help a lot with the rubber smell. Not everyone has allergies, so this might not be an issue for all folks--but I couldn't use these cables for anything near my face for the first few months.They're cheap and they work fine. I haven't noticed any sound issues at all.",Positive
I've had this cable for awhile and I'm not too impressed with the quality. The plug and jack look cheap and the cable is thin. I use it at home on a practice mic and it hasn't had much of a workout. I don't think it would hold up long on stage at a venue.,Positive
"The Gain on this mic isn't the greatest, but for speeches and soft recordings: this guy can handle it all very well!",Positive
"I have a few Shure SM58s which cost more.  I like the open sound of the PG48 but vocals seem to break up more at higher volumes than they do with the SM58s.  I like this mic ok but the SM58 is worth the extra money I think, especially if you expect to push its capability.",Positive
I only do test recording with this digitally to get a better Idea of my learning process from the other side. It gives a clean crisp reproduction of every flaw I have.,Positive
"I use this for Video Exchanges on a guitar instruction website. It's perfect for vocals, podcasting, video recording and so forth. Shure makes excellent stuff. What's also great is you save some money as an XLR cable is included. I'm very happy with this purchase.",Positive
"4 stars instead of 5 only because this thing won't tune your guitar or carry your amp. I use this solo, in a duo with a bass player, in a trio with drums and bass. I have a regular gig at a medium sized club that is basically one large room. I use it through a Pyle Pro self contained Pa into which I also plug my Martin GRP elec/acoustic. The sound quality is excellent. The volume seems limited only bny what the Pyle Pro will put out. I would have no hesitation using this for bigger rooms with a full band and PA. I haven't heard a hint of feedback and the on/off switch is a plus.The 36.99 price might seem to good to be true but think of the things for which we are paying less for than we used to. I bought a 32&#34; Toshiba flat screen for around 230 bucks, Think of what that would have cost even five years ago or less. The same is true of a lot of Audio Gear. A lot of companies are bringing high quality elctronics and music to the market but it's great to have a company like Shure make something so good and so affordable. They have always made a high quality product and now they have one that almost anyone can afford. I cannot recommend it strongly enough.",Positive
"So far, I'm very happy with this Microphone. Tone quality is fine and does everything I need it to do for backup vocals in my band. Although a longer cable would be nice, it's great a cable and was included in the package.",Positive
"It is so hard to get an honest review of any mike that isn't a Shure SM58. This is considered the gold standard by which all others are measured. Of course at least part of this reputation is deserved, but perhaps more for the durability of the SM58 than its sound. I have a couple of SM58s and a couple of PG58s. I was considering the SM48, but the PG58 has slightly better specs, and almost identical price.The first thing I noticed out of the box was that the PG58 is slightly bigger and slightly heavier. It also has a different switch than the SM58. The metal screens protecting them aren't interchangeable. I then plugged in one microphone cable so the settings would be identical. I tried both mikes, one after the other, first with speaking and then with singing and playing guitar, and then I changed the settings, or more specifically, the effects and the EQ on the PA. I repeated the experiment, speaking and then singing while changing between mikes.Here's what I noticed: The SM58 is slightly flatter in the mid range. The PG58 is slightly brighter and has a touch more presence. They are about equal on volume. The slight differences in tone can be easily manipulated with an EQ or just ordinary tone controls. Neither was susceptible to much feedback or vocal pop.I haven't tried out this side by side comparison in a live situation or even in practice, as it's too time consuming and interferes with playing. It's difficulty to judge in those situations too, or at least awkward, but I have used a combination of the two in practice and no one seems to be able to tell the difference, except one person actually expressed a preference for the PG58, but that could be just the settings.I looked at the specs for the two mikes side by side. The SM58 is a little flatter in response, especially at the high end, over 10K Hz, and it picks up a few dB before the PG 58, somewhere between 50 and 60 Hz. However, since the human vocal range is generally between around 300 and 3000 Hz, neither of these seems likely to have much effect, although the SM58 might be a tad more responsive for a bass singer.I also tried out two different Behringer mikes and a Radio Shack mike. The Behringer 8500 was totally outclassed by both of the Shures, sounding tinny and thin and with little presence or volume. I tried out a Behringer 2000XM and was impressed by the similarity. These mikes sound almost identical (The B 2000 and the Shure SM). The Behringer 2000XM seems to have been discontinued, though, and replaced with the 1800XM, an inferior mike offered in bundles of three for under $50.I then plugged in a Radio Shack mike that was a spare backup, not even taken out for practice. The model number is 33-3001, probably also discontinued. This was an excellent sounding mike, with good volume, presence and tone.I didn't have any other mikes to test in this side by side experiment, but I did reach some conclusions:There is quite a bit of snobbery in choosing microphones, with the Shure SM58 held up as some unreachable standard. They ARE sturdy, and they are good mikes and the price is not unreasonable, at around $100. However, there are other microphones which sound nearly identical and are also sturdy and reliable, at lower prices, including the Shure PG58, and most likely the SM48, though I didn't have any of those to test.I wish more people would give unbiased reviews based on actual performance instead of condescension toward those who are either on a budget or looking for alternatives to the standard bearer. I'm giving this 4 stars only because I haven't had enough time to give an evaluation of how this holds up in comparison to the SM58.",Positive
This microphone is great for singing with a PA and an electric guitar. I sing worship/praise songs and southern gospel and it is very smooth in the mid range and when you get up close it enhances the bass nicely. I don't think it is the same as an SM58 but it is exactly what I need. Built to last and it is a Shure.,Positive
"Just got this, have used it for recording and rehearsal, it works well so far and I will revise the review if that somehow changes in the next few years.  Right now, though, I'd say great product.",Positive
"I bought this one to replace a Shure 8900. It's a big step up from that one. I am pleased with it. The old one had a lot of handling noise. This one has a little but it is very good for the money I paid for it. My next one will be an SM58, but that will be awhile from now. I'm very happy with this PG58.Update:December 2012The handling noise is definitely something to consider. It would keep me from buying another one of these. Other mics I own don't have this problem to this degree.",Positive
"I started with the Shure PG58 and most recently acquired the Shure SM58.  I'd probably be all too ready to agree with those who argue that a Neumann or Telefunken mic costing 5 G's simply isn't that much better than a Nady mic costing 10 bucks.  But with respect to the Shure, I'm less sure that the SM58 isn't worth 40% more than the PG58.  Perhaps if you have a sufficiently high-powered and ""clean"" amplifier and have tweaked the EQ settings to favor the frequencies of the human voice, the two mics could be mistaken for one another.  It was my attempts to occasionally use an instrument amplifier as an emergency P.A. that led me to realize the PG58 sounded somewhat muted and dull compared to the SM58.  Switching to the more common, admittedly more expensive mic, gave me just the extra gain I needed along with added crispness and clarity to the voice (at least for announcements).P.S. I notice that the head of the PG58 is larger than that of the SM58.  Since the rise of the ""digital audio workstation"" (who doesn't have a computer with free, included Garage Band on it?), large, even gold-plated, expensive-looking but cheap mics are on display all over the place.  Despite appearances, when it comes to mics, size doesn't matter--except for appearances (directors of high school show bands will dispense those headsets that wrap half-way around the face, knowing that the girls in the front-line think they're cool--they look just like Madonna'a or Janet's headgear). Some of the best mics are tiny, with an opening the size of a pin-hole.",Positive
good mic for simple live stuff that isn't too expensive.  it gets a good clear sound and has an on off switch that helps with all kinds of things,Positive
This is a proven classic.  Using it to mic my Mesa Boogie Mark V 1x12 cabinet.  Sounds fantastic and is solidly built.,Positive
"This is the #1 mic you should get, recording or live, instruments or voice, it always come through  with a great sound and seems almost indestructible.looking forward to work with it on future projects, can't believe it took me so long to get one of those",Positive
"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a ""Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.""  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.  You can not go wrong unless you get too close with no windscreen.",Positive
"Good all around mike. If you are looking for a solid mike to start your studio, I recommend this one. Best used for guitar and mid range instrument recording but not bad on vocals. Best mike for the price and purpose.",Positive
"Seriously?  The Shure SM57 sets the standard, which by all other instrument microphones are judged.No kidding.  They work great with guitar (for a REAL acoustic guitar sound, drums, congas, tablas... You name it..  if it's an instrument the SM57 delivers.I hear it's good for vocals as well.  When the President gives a speech, the SM57 is there.In my experience a vocalist better have above average pipes to use the SM57.  The SM58 is better suited to those who lack vocal projection (most wannabe's).For instrument sound reinforcement...  bar-none... the best.",Positive
"If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums, its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor, PG seies, digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure.",Positive
"There's a reason every mic cabinet has at least one of these (and if it doesn't, it should).  This is a great all purpose dynamic mic, I use it for instruments, vocals, even field recording sometimes.  The SM58 has a frequency response that is supposed to be more tailored towards vocals, but that doesn't mean that the 57 can't handle a voice.  They're pretty much the same mic as far as I'm concerned, and for the average amateur recording engineer or home studio practitioner I think you'll find the same thing.  And if you're operating at a level where you refuse to use them interchangeably, then you probably already know what you're looking for.  I'll be getting a 58 to add to my personal cabinet soon, but if you're like me and wanted to spend more on a nice condenser before filling out your dynamic mics, you can't go wrong here.",Positive
I use this to mic snare drums and sometimes guitar cabinets. It works as well as most mics and is more durable than most. I have used this in the studio when nothing else was available and it worked fine. As long as I run sound for a living I will keep some of these mics.,Positive
"Considering that the SM57 was introduced to the world in 1967, a year after the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone, I guess the 58 gets Batman status, relegating the 57 to that of Robin. But that's not really a fair assessment considering the 57 and 58 were developed at the same time, and except for the 58's acoustic foam lined cage pop screen, the two mics are identical electrically.The SM (Studio Microphone) 57 was designed to begin it's life in a recording studio, as a dynamic microphone used to mic the ever increasing volume of rock and roll amplifiers, drum kits, etc. In that capacity, it had no use for the pop screen of it's cousin the SM58, still one of the most sold vocal mics in the world to this day. So the SM57 slimmed down and even though it's still a fine vocal mic, you'll see it used mostly mic'ing instruments, which it excels at.One of it's long time and most important roles has been the official podium mic for the White House. A pair of SM57's is always seen on various White House podiums for press conferences and there is even a VIP bundled kitShure SM57 VIP Dual Microphone Kityou can buy for this exact type of use.The SM57 is an extremely rugged mic, built to tough standards and can take lots of road abuse. That's one of the things that makes it popular with touring bands and sound companies. And on top of that, it's just a great sounding mic for the price.There is a Performer SeriesShure Beta 57A Microphonethat looks very similar to the SM57 but the Beta 57 has a different mic capsule and transformer and sounds different. So make sure you try before you buy.Bottom line is the Shure SM57 is one tough road mic that sounds awesome and is not overly priced. A best value for sound companies, home studio recordists and touring musicians.",Positive
"I use this for recording guitars as well as live vocals.  I've knocked this microphone around a decent amount, and it is plenty rugged.  I couldn't be happier with it.",Positive
"This mic is well made (heavy on the mic-end).  However, I have yet to try it with my multi-track studio.",Positive
"I bought this for my teen son for Christmas. He loves to play his bass and sing along. He had a different Shure mic and it was totally flat compared to this particular model. Nice and clean sounds, plus it seems pretty sturdy. We did get him a mic stand and it fits on it perfectly and stays put. Shure knocked this one out of the park.",Positive
these are my preferred mics for practice and gigs... an all around tough mic....great for all your needs...I highly recommend them..,Positive
"The industry standard for live performance, the SM58 has withstood the test of time and for good reason. These are the only microphones that I perform with, and the on/off switch makes it easier so I don't have to power down all of my gear when I am done practicing...I just turn the mic off.",Positive
"It is not a bad mic for the price ( If you want a real good one with studio quality mic it would cost over 600 bucks) but it is no comparison to a studio mic since I have worked in a recording studio. Now, you need to decide what you want, getting a studio mic alone does not give you the result you are looking for; it is like having HD TV and BD player but playing an ordinary CD. You would have to compliment the mic with many other products like a studio quality mixer, speakers and so on. If you are a home or hobby user, then go for this mic. This mic is quite good for its price. I would probably say, it exceeds your expectations.Arrived as promised in a frustration free packing. Also, make sure you buy a foam mic hood for the mic to save it from unwanted dirt and spit.The only reason I did not give 5 stars is , mine had a little dent on the body ( may be due to transportation) but it has nothing to do with the function but just the looks.",Positive
"How do you review an SM58?? I've used these most of my life, and will continue to. Very durable, I got this to replace the same, a 20 year old, rusted / dented grill 58 :) I also use a D5 (AKG - same price) and a line 6 wirelesss, but the 58 is always reliable first choice or backup.",Positive
"The first rule of microphones is that, ""No one microphone is perfect for every purpose.""  Rule two is, ""Experiment with different mics in different applications to find your signature sound.""  I've used Shure SM58's along with their ancestors and relatives back to 1968.  I primarily used them for broadcasting and recording spoken word content but I have used (and still do use) them for singing some back up vocals.The SM58 does one thing well and that is vocal performance when used very close to the mouth for public address use.  Some people, me included, actually sound better and more comfortable in a live performance setting when using another mic, the Shure SM-57.  The SM-58 is a very good vocal mic and for some people probably the best choice.  For example, anyone who can not resist putting the mic right up against their lips while singing will probably want the SM-58.  People with softer or weaker voices will want the SM-58.The SM-58 is highly directional and has a noticeable yet manageable proximity effect (which means the bass increases the closer you get.)  This mic does not pick up well from much over 8 inches away.  The reason so many singers think you are supposed to shove microphones practically inside your mouth is because the ball type Shure vocal mics require you to get them very close or they don't sound right.  On the other hand, the SM-57 sounds best several inches away from the user's mouth and works fine up to 12 inches away.  While the SM-58 is certainly the number one professional PA vocal mic, there are precious few other uses for it because it has a colored sound with a prominent frequency response boost in the upper midrange plus a sound source has to be very close before it is picked up clearly.  It works ok for conga drums and the like, but the SM-58 is about the last thing you'd want to use to mic a sax or guitar.  Personally these mics are not the best for my mic technique or the basic nature my voice, but for some people they sound great.  The live vocal mic that works best for me is the Shure SM-57 with a windscreen.  However for other people the SM-58 works better.  It depends on your voice and what you want the mic to do.  If you have a very deep voice, the SM-58 might be the second best choice after the SM-57 which has a better low frequency response.One certain advantage of the SM-58 is the excellent gain before feedback capability.  This mic can be turned up louder than almost any other mic without that annoying PA squeal.  Another advantage of the SM-58 is that it is still available (at a slight extra cost) with a built-in on/off switch.  The SM-58's ball shaped grills are very sturdy and even if you should dent one you can get a replacement which screws right on for about ten dollars.  I've seen SM-58's dented, rusty, dusty, smoked up, spit into, with pieces missing and slammed into a hardwood stage with the full weight of a boom stand adding mass to the fall and yet I've never seen but one stop working and that malfunction was due to an on/off switch that got dirt in it.All the pro-line Shure mics are top quality.  The pro line Shures also hold their value well.  If you buy one and decide you don't like it, you can get about what you paid for it on eBay.  I would compare as many mics as possible before buying one.  Senneheiser's EVOLUTION mics sound really good too and are worth a look. The SM-58 will be the number one on-stage vocal mic for the foreseeable future because most people follow the crowd instead of actually trying out different mics and picking the one that works best for their particular voice.  These things are so durable that even if they stopped making them today they'd still be around for another 20 years at least.",Positive
"legendary performance indeed! works perfectly, extremely easy to set up, very good sound, good price, that's 'bout all you need to know!",Positive
"Great all around mic used for vocals.  No frills, tough as nails, and great sound for live music.  If you're buying your first mic (or switching from a cheapie) and intend to use it for singing/vocals, this is a mic that any musician would probably recommend without hesitation.  I've never used another one since the first time I switched from a cheaper mic (that came with some bundle) 10 years ago.  I depend on the smoothness of my vocals to carry off songs and this mic reproduces the warm sounds I like perfectly.  You can stand 3 feet away and really wail, or get up close for some bass response, or anything in between.The SM58-CN comes with the mic, 25-ft cable, cable tie, carry pouch, and mic clip.  The standard SM58 does not have a switch (one less thing to break and I don't miss it)  but the SM58-S does have it for a few dollars extra.",Positive
"I've just got the Shure SM58 microphone.As expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product.Also, I've bought it at Amazon and they sold through J&R; Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier. They shipped in less time than expected.I'm a really happy customer now.",Positive
no complaints here! the quality is great! the sounds is excellent! and my voice sounds wonderful and crisp. use it all the time.,Positive
A nice addition to my recording home studio!  I recommend it for any one who records ballads or light classical music.,Positive
This mic works better for some people than others. That being said it is the first mic I put in a lead singers hand upon meeting them. If it doesn't sound good then I try something else. I have no complaints it is my GO TO MIC.,Positive
"I bought two microphones, a AKG D5 and SM58.  I like AKG D5 a little better than this because the vocal sounded a lot clearer and crisp on the AKG.The SM sounded muted compared to D5 without any sound modification out of box.  The output is also a little less sensitive than the D5.However I like the look of SM58 and it seems to be extremely durable.",Positive
"In the immortal words that John Cameron Swayze used when hawking his Timex watches during the early days of live television, the Shure SM58 Vocal mic fits perfectly into that same category.Before I found a career as a film and television sound recordist and mixer, I played in rock bands and did live sound mixing. One of the very first mics we truly fell in love with was the SM58. Introduced by the Shure Brothers Company in 1966, the SM58 quickly rose to become the industry standard in rugged road mics that actually sound good to the ear and are nearly indestructible.The mic capsule is of cardiord (heart shaped) design which helps reject sound from either side. There is a 4K bump in it's frequency which helps vocals cut through stage noise. Construction is rugged, frequency response is 50 to 15,000 Hz, and the capsule sits internally on a foam shock mount to help isolate it from handling noise.We used to joke about the SM58 in that if you needed a hammer and you couldn't find one, just grab one of these, they are that tough. I've seen some of these on the road that you couldn't believe still worked, but they did and sounded great.The cage style pop screen gives the SM58 not only it's distinctive look, one that influenced many other mic brands from the day it was introduced, but it's part of the functionality. Internally lined with a layer of acoustic foam, the cage helps keep vocals pops from getting to the dynamic mic element. As a frame of reference, theShure SM57LC Shure SM57 Cardioid Dynamic Microphoneis the same exact mic and capsule, but without the pop screen.Shure also sells a Performer series mic, theShure Beta 58A Supercardioid Dynamic Microphonethat looks almost identical to the SM58 but uses a totally different mic capsule and transformer and has a different sound so try before you buy.The Shure SM58 is still considered the industry standard of live performance mics today and for the price, they really are a good deal.",Positive
"I made the mistake of thinking I could save forty bucks and get by with the Shure PG-58.  I'm no vocalist but occasionally need to do announcements or accommodate a guest vocalist through an instrument amp (rather than a P.A.). Whatever the reason, the PG-58 simply doesn't have sufficient gain or oomph to be of much use with the Roland Cube / Peavey amps I try to employ it with (I use a 1/4"" adapter with the XLR connector that comes with the mic).  When I borrow a Shure SM-58 mic from someone, the difference is instant and dramatic--it's a far more efficient (i.e. louder) mic, producing a full, clear sound, and without additional pre-amplification, demonstrating why it's the most popular microphone in the world.  For five bucks extra, I can't fathom a reason for avoiding the SM-58S, the version with an on-off switch.  It's a small price to pay for quick solutions to feedback or the unwanted pick-up of ""private"" comments by indiscreet band members.  And even if you're an instrumentalist, it may be wiser to select the SM-58 over the SM-57.  The former mic is a little more ostentatious, but it's also slightly more adaptable, and the screen can filter out a certain amount of wind noise and unwanted non-musical sounds. Above all, the SM-58 has proven itself to be the Sherman tank of microphones, simply unparalleled for ruggedness and durability.[I see a review cautioning the consumer to be wary of ""this seller.""  Perhaps a good point unless it's in reference to Amazon Prime, which is the Shure SM-58 of commerce: competitive prices, no postage, easy returns.  But anyone who returns an SM58 probably had no business buying it in the first place.  They are the populous drones of the industry, invariably purchased by professionals who know first-hand what they're getting--reliability and virtual indestructibility.  In fact, it's the very popularity of the SM58 that has led to all of the slightly less or more expensive imitators.  Consumers require choice, but with the Shure SM58 there need be none.]",Positive
There are plenty of flashier - prettier - modern-er looking or more nostalgic looking microphones out there.  Its all just so much marketing garbage. These mics are the best mic for the buck out there.  Anyone who claims to be able to tell the difference between this and far more expensive ones is blowing smoke up your a**.,Positive
"The mic is well made (heavy on the &#34;mic&#34; end), but I have yet to try it with my pop filter and multi-track studio.",Positive
"This is a well made, low noise and low cost cable. Unless you make a lot of money with your recordings, this will do just fine!",Positive
"Didn't know what to expect for under $10, but it proved to be worth the gamble.This cable appears to be well constructed and it works fine for me(amateur use, infrequent setup/teardowns).It's a decent 15 feet long, and has a locking button on the female end.I'm quite happy with it.",Positive
"I use this cable for small home recording projects. I do not take the cable around to gigs or shows, as I am pretty sure it wouldn't last longer than a few months of heavy use. The sound quality is fine and the metal connecters feel a little bit flimsy. If your looking for something that is cheap and will do the job, this is your product.",Positive
Pay a couple bucks more and you get one from a brand like Audio Technica and you know it's going to withstand the test of time.  Mine is working fairly well but the attachments are loosening so who knows what's next.,Positive
"Everyone develops personal preferences over time for one reason or another.  I have a personal preference for the XLR ends with the really fine threaded plastic cap on the outside (first to slide down the cable) with a 4 legged gripper underneath that slides next down the cable and pinches down as you tighten the plastic outer cap into the metal housing with the solder contacts causing the gripper to strain relief most cable diameters.  Unfortunately that design isn't used here, but I chose to award the 5 star rating for value because you get 15' of good quality shielded cable with 2 XLR ends (M and F) for well under $1/ft.As for pinout it's straightforward, pin 1 is tied to the metal grip and shield and connects between both ends, while pins 2 and 3 are run isolated between both ends.  The end design chosen uses the single set screw connector (the tiny one that gets lost so easy if you need to take it apart) and the rubber bumper design on the back which I haven't had the best of luck making quick changes in the field with, however for interconnecting equipment on a temporary basis these cables are an important starting point of any audio engineer's kit because they will be used not if but WHEN the need arises.Another favorite of mine is the 6 pack of 3 foot male to female cables which do use my favorite XLR ends mentioned above, which amazon will rush you:GLS Audio 3ft Patch Cable Cords - XLR Male To XLR Female Black Cables - 3' Balanced Snake Cord - 6 PACK- these are very easy to open an end, change phase, lift ground, or input someone's oddball source signal.  Having 6 on hand means you won't quibble over cable costs before the show starts and that channel will be in the final mix.Back to pyle's product here, I basically took away 1 star for not using the easy to open and re-wire XLRs but gave them a star for value in the product since it's 15 feet long and will reach between my mixer and most anything else inside the booth for under a buck a foot.  It's also great when someone yells ""it's too short I need a cable stretcher at the podium!"" and quickly adds 15 feet of noise free movement to a stage snake that either wasn't planned for or got moved/quit working.  For the price they have saved many installations from being torn up or rewired which means no surprises opening the next showing.I finally equipped my cable kit with the usual XLR to  RCA, 1/4 TRS, hi-z transformers, and the above mentioned 6 pack of 3 foot cables to quickly gain access to the XLR terminals if need be, plus 2 of these 15 foot cables mainly to solve distance problems, and a roll of gaffer's tape for good measure to prevent tripping hazards.  I used to have 2ea 50 foot XLR cables but no sooner than the box was opened one became a permanent addition to the stage snake so now I have one left for my kit. With all that I had to build an emergency XLR to 2.5mm TS all metal shielded connector for a mike input on short notice so a soldering kit with misc plugs got added to my cable bin.  Even though all this was under $100 it has saved the day more than once and made the show go on, so a bit of ""what if"" thinking and judicial purchases can make you look like the miracle mixer in the black painted room and justify your existance when the owner's daugher's toy musicbox becomes a channel in the house mix thanks to some quick cable magic.My last cable advice is never deconstruct something you custom made.  It will no doubt be needed again, and since you made it you'll know why, how, and where it was used before, thus you save time not recreating a past fix rather pulling it from your magic box of tricks and solving the problem.  People think you can hook anything up where others tried and failed furthering your staff position.  My only exception goes to cables that violate every standard and didn't serve to fix the problem like that phase reversed ground lifted XLR 4 pin stereo Y splitter to dual TRS female cable I made for the harmonica duet where the performers had nose rings and lip bars pierced and kept getting static with their mics when they held the harmonica up to their jewelry.  I chalked that up to being part of the intended musical signal, wondering just how much it hurt to play with all the piercings scraping along the harmonica when I setup my monitor speakers to listen to just that (stereo) channel in rehersal at the console.",Positive
This is a great chord for anyone needing to not spend the money on a high quality chord... It's no PEAVEY but it works just as good...,Positive
"The product feels a little on the ""cheap"" side, but definitely does the job the way it should- so that's all I care about. It was cheap, and came fast. I recommend it.",Positive
I bought a pair of these cables and they work just fine.  There doesn't seem to be any noise and they seem to be built to last.  They do what they're supposed to do.,Positive
"This was one of two I purchased. Also bought the 25' Length and used them on an assignment recently.  They fit my RODE Mic nice and tight, other cords I have bought didn't and the sound quality is excellent. If Amazon allowed a link I would give you a link to a video I just finished on the Independence of the Seas.  Go to my website and look for it...IPA IMPRESS dot Com",Positive
"Not much to say other than it's a good cable. Good solid connections with no play. After consistent use, it's going strong.",Positive
"No complaints, it's quiet enough and the price is right. Is it a Monster cable? No, but it doesn't cost as much either. I've used this on lead vocal tracks into a studio condensor mic for professional album sessions and it was fine.",Positive
well made and the perfect length for my needs. the shielding was great as well. the end connectors were well made and strong.,Positive
"I purchased this to connect a Sennheiser E825 mike with guitar amps. This requires, of course, the addition of a 1/4 inch adapter plug. The cable itself has worked perfectly and proved both durable and of a suitable length at least for jamming with friends and playing in small venues. Recommended.UPDATE: I marked this product down one star after a connector fell apart during what I regarded as relatively light duty. The set screw fell out and could not be found. I've had similar problems with other Pyle products. If you buy them, I recommend tat you get a micro-screwdriver set as well so that you can tighten te connector screws before you have a similar xperience.",Positive
"Like most products on the market, depending on where and how the item is used, your experience may vary. For me, this cable is going to be used on a semi-stationary mic stand in my project studio, and thus far, it's done nothing but an exceptional job. I tested the cable with a few different mics and in each scenario, the signal was just as strong as the some of the other, more pricey cables out there. Would I purchase this again? Absolutely!",Positive
"The extra length gives me more flexibility and maneuverability.  Cord works well and hasn't been any problem, to date.  Plugs directly to the system, or my mini-amp.  Works well.",Positive
"I have to tell you guys, these XLR cables that I have received recently are by far the best quality cables I have ever encountered in my entire music (professional) life.I would suggest these cables to any one of my colleagues.",Positive
Got a packet to try but I found they are better than the Gator screws that came with my case! My equipment is very secure. Highly recommended.,Positive
They are screws. They screw in and hold things. To say that they did less would've gotten the 1 star. I like them.,Positive
Good quality rack screws that come with rubber washers to protect face of equipment.  Arrived ahead of estimated arrival time which is always nice.,Positive
Excellent rack screws with washers. Its fit very good to rack holes. Good presentation and well packed. I will buy again.,Positive
So far the ones I have used have all threaded nicely into our 16u rack. There are exactly as described and do the job. What more can a guy say about a little box of screws? Maybe I should post some pics of the little buggers in action?,Positive
"Pros:* They look very nice.* They cause much less wear than the 2nd hand rack screws and washers.Cons:* More expensive and I had to wait a few days longer than it took my rack equipment to ship.I'd purchase these again, but I now have 25 but only need 16 at the most once my rack is filled.",Positive
"I replaced all the stock mounting screws that came with our sound rack cabinet with these, as they were nearly invisible with the black rails and mounting plates. The plastic washers also seem to protect the finishes better than metal washers on the equipment I mounted. Inexpensive, and worth it.",Positive
"Donr be fooled by the imitations... should be their slogan. There are some real junky ones out there and these are great, love the washers, life savers. Thanks!",Positive
"Great rack mount screws. Rubber washers are perfect, lets it give your item that tight fit without worry of the screws working out any time soon. I use them on my portable desktop rack with my mobile DJ equipment and they have held strong.",Positive
"Other than that, when you need 10-32 rack screws, these are the real McCoy.  Wide enough pan to grab the ear, narrow enough to clear that next piece of gear!  Thanks, Raxxess!",Positive
"There are other rack screws out there, but Raxxess makes the best quality screws and soft washers available.",Positive
Well if this review survives the censors just know that these are great screws when you run out of the original screws you were supplied with your new rack.  They work.,Positive
"Mics are like pants, you have to find the right fit. This one I like for my vocals live. I sing fairly low and airy - works great for me. Also used to mic resonator guitar through a tube mic preamp live, very sweet sound. I prefer it to the 58, seems a bit more bright and natural. Might purchase another one eventually...",Positive
Why drive a Pinto when you can drive a Cadillac? This is the industries best mic as far as I am concerned. I had a Shure SM 58 like everyone else owned but there is no comparison between this mic and a SM58. SM 58 is garbage compared to the Beta 58A. Spring for the extra bucks and be happy. That's what I always say.,Positive
"I have one of these, as well as several other microphones. The SM58 is a good all around mic - the reason it's an industry standard/go-to, but the Beta 58A is a better (in my opinion) vocal-specific mic...basically giving (again, in my opinion) a higher quality sound. The SM58 by comparison sounds muffled/muddy, where the Beta58A is clearer, stronger, and more articulate. If you're used to the SM58, then the Beta58A can sound thin and harsh, but, that is adjustable at the board - end result is that it's a tighter sounding mic with more clarity.Pattern-wise, it does better at rejecting unwanted sounds - I play drums and use this mic for that reason, is that it picks up less of my drums than a SM57 or a SM58.",Positive
"Yes, it costs considerably more than the SM58 and I'm not sure if I could pass a comparison test between the two, but I love this mic!  To me, it sounds slightly brighter and clearer than the 58s I have used in the past.  If you are a musician who is strapped for cash or trying to make ends meet, get the 58.  If you have the extra dough and want a confidence boost, go for the Beta.  I would buy this again.",Positive
"I'm an amateur sound tech. We've been using SM58 in our church for years now and our singers/song leaders liked it very much than the other mics that we've had before. Our singers are growing and we needed addtional mic so we thought of this Beta58A because of the good reviews. When I received it I cannot wait to test it myself and whoaaah.. For me, it sounded better than SM58. My songleaders have tested it and guess what... they dont want to use the SM58 anymore :)",Positive
"While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals, and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship, the Beta 58A needs to be given its due. The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or ""popping"" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny. Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority. Six out of five stars!",Positive
"The Beta 58A along with the original SM58 are industry standards, that's well known. As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.""Built like a tank"" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal. Chances are, its in working order no matter what.",Positive
"I actually replaced a BOSS TR2 with this pedal. Does everything it is supposed to do without the ""perceived"" (that's was they say) volume loss typical of many tremolo pedals. If it's perceived, then how do you explain how good this sounds? I have since had the pedal rehoused in a metal enclosure with a better switch because I was scared of breaking its plastic housing when switching it on and off.",Positive
"Hey, it gets the job done and that's all I can ask for.  I tried several ""cheapo"" pedals, and this one was my favorite of them all.  While some had better casings (metal instead of plastic), at the end of the day I'm looking for a good sound, not a pretty pedal board.  The pedal seems solid enough, it doesn't take up much space, it sounds great, and it has a versatile range of sounds as far as tremolo pedals come.AND, if you are like the typical musician, you are looking for something that's not going to break the bank.",Positive
"When I first started setting up my little studio, I wanted something that didn't break the budget.  I tried a couple different combo pedal boards, (Digitech 500, Boss ME-70), but quickly realized I wasn't getting my sound and the money was quickly drying up.  With not much left, I tried a Tuna Melt as an example of Danelectro.  Who would think?  This thing is stunning in its ability to manufacture vintage tremolo sounds, as are most of this line of pedals.  I now own about 12-14 of these of all types, and have never been dissapointed save it's very hard to chain them without a lot of noise.Then I got into guitar building, and they all got put away.  Lately, I have been trying to make time to improve my playing skills, and joy of joys! I am rediscovering all these pedals and I absolutely love them.Forget the FAB series, they are not so hot.  Buy the old style as the Tuna Melt, or the big metal ones like the Dan Echo.  You will NOT be sorry!",Positive
"Hello Musicfriends - This is built cheap but sounds great. Good controls too. For me in the studio/songwriting  its perfect but I would not exactly go on tour with it..... There is something about the knobs I still love, even if all my other digital units have a tremolo hidden in it... may be  the age thing...",Positive
"it sounds great.  nice and warm and lush.  one of the better trems i've had the pleasure to use.  however, i hate the plastic housing, and how the input/output jacks are located.  I don't have heavy feet, so it will probably last a good long while on my board, but i really wouldn't want to put too much weight on it.",Positive
"It is exactly what you need in a capo! You can cover all six strings, move one string over to get a drop d tuning or turn the capo upside down to get a partial capo (though a bit of adjusting may be needed to get the strings held down.).All in all, a great capo that is well made and will last forever.Kyser is an awesome small Christian company and I really like their products and supporting them with my purchases. :]",Positive
Love these capos and nice that you can get them in other colours.  Prevents you from getting yours confused with some one elses.,Positive
"My son needed a Capo, expensive at music  shop where he takes lessons.  At Amazon found what he wanted at reasonable price.",Positive
"The title says it all.  I got it for $16 (free shipping with Amazon Prime), which is cheaper than my local music store.  I keep it on the head of the guitar, and it is easy to add, move, remove.  With the trigger-type release, it makes it one of the easiest quick-change capos I've used.  It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum).  And best of all... it works!",Positive
"I like it, it works well with my takamine acoustic jasmine s35 guitar. And it looks good. Overall, I recommend.",Positive
"Quick to clip on and off. Really... Is there anything else to say? What else do you want it to do?These suckers are wonderfully reliable.I've had one for about 10 years. The only thing that went wrong with it was the removable rubber on the ""bottom"" of the capo became damaged because of my own neglect. However, for a $1, keyser sent me a bag of a about 6 of them. Can you go wrong? NO!Great product!",Positive
a couple of bucks more than dunlop...which i have not tried..i own a couple wish they were cheeper i would have one in each case..but it works fine..and is well made...arrived on time..enjoy,Positive
"Like this camo capo's simplicity and its unique color.  My friend got a new one after seeing me using it, but his is a bit shorter than mine.  Mine works both uke & acoustic guitar, I have no problem to use it on single hand.  As the manufactor suggests for its duration, I don't clip it on the guitar when it's not in use. :)",Positive
"This Capo looks great and does the job. It does take a bit of pressure to open the camp, but its better then the winding versions.",Positive
"Purchased the 6-string Kyser capo when I meant to get the 12-string version (slightly longer, stronger spring?), but find that this 6-string Capo not only works great on my 2 6-string acoustics, but also works on my 12-string acoustic with a little adjusting.  Quality seems top notch, design is simple and effective.",Positive
I've owned the same one for 10 years and it's still going strong after many gigs. The spring tension is just right.,Positive
Basically because they are the easiest to squeeze in my opinion.  I have big hands which may be part of it.,Positive
"high quality hassle free design.  Very quick and easy to install and remove in a hurry and dosn't mar the finish or use excessive force,  but strong enough to move the capo all the way close to the next fret closer to the headstock to allow maximum room for my fingers without any buzzing.  Very happy with this purchase.",Positive
"I have had one for two years and no complaints, needed another for my travel guitar.  The lever arm is coated with a soft plastic sleeve which protects the neck, the spring is firm and in 2 years has not given up any tension. Finally on the string compression side the material is firm yet supple.  I take particular caution to make sure that I don't leave it on anything that would indent that material permanently...",Positive
I've seen and used many different types of capos over the years and they range from the very cumbersome and difficult to use to the easily breakable but I've never used one as convenient and as well constructed as this Kyser one.  It is by far the best I've ever seen and I've been using it for years now and it still works fine.  It makes moving the capo quickly a cinch and the gold doesn't corrode or tarnish making it look like new even after all these years.Very highly recommended!,Positive
"It is very well made, is easy to use, and holds down the strings just fine.  It is well protected as to not scratch or nick your guitar.",Positive
"Durable, affordable, easy to grasp and use.",Positive
This capo is as good as I've ever used and its in pink which perfectly matchs my shell pink strat. Great deal.,Positive
"I currenty use two types of capos - the Kyser one and Shubb capos.  Both are the most popular capos around but have different strengths and weaknesses.The benefits of the Kyser is that it is the quickest changing capo I've come across, doesn't require tension adjustment, and can clip to the end of the headstock when not in use.  The primary benefit of the Shubb is that it has adjustable tension (and second, it's smaller).The main drawback of the Kyser is the lack of adjustable tension.  Because it's designed to work across the fretboard, it will apply more force than necessary to clamp down the lower frets, causing frets to wear faster over time.  Because of this I prefer to use the Kyser on my less expensive guitar and the Shubbs on the guitar I baby.",Positive
Easy to useGreat quality and I am looking forward to purchasing more of this brand. Thank you very much,Positive
"Got what I needed - a basic capo for a good price.  The tension is a little tighter than I'd like, but works for me.  Covers all strings, and depresses them fully.  I don't use it often, so I can't speak to its longevity, but good for me!",Positive
"I've played guitar for 5 years. Seen many different capos, but none that quite satisfies me as the Kyser.You really can't go wrong with this capo. It is very mobile, easily adjustable, sturdy, and durable.What's good about this capo is that you can use it as a regular 6 String capo and still turn it around to use it asa Cut capo. The transparent rubber piece does the same job.It comes in different colors also.I own the black, silver, gold, and camo Kyser capos.I also own the Cut Capo for other styles.I recommend it!All the capos I've had from Kyser are still in great conditions.Use them all the time at church and at home",Positive
I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them. They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times. Great capos. You won't be disappointed.,Positive
"I originally bought this for my guitar and it worked very well for that, so I tried it out on my 4 string uke and it works just as great. It's so much better than the elastic capos. So, it's doing double duty and going strong.",Positive
"This style of capo CAN throw your guitar out of tune if you don't put it on right. When used correctly though, it does it's job just fine.",Positive
"I can only repeat what everyone else has already said: this Kyser capo is designed and built very well. It's easy to put on and adjust, and just as easy to take off. There are probably a few capos out there that are a bit flashier, but this is still pretty stylish. And the price makes it a real bargain.",Positive
"I don't believe there is such a thing as a perfect capo, but this one is quite good.  For those with reasonably strong hands it is pretty easy to use.  It does a very good job of compressing the strings to the frets and is definitely well built.  It is as with all capos,  important to take it off when not in use so the ""rubber"" does not get grooved.  This is just good common sense.  If this lasts a couple of years I will definitely purchase another.",Positive
I bought a 12 string one in blk.  Love it for simplicity and needed it so I didn't have to keep searching for the other.  Got gold to remind me it is for six strings.,Positive
"I have used a few different capo's this is far and away my favorite. Very easy to take it off, holds the strings tight. What more can you ask for? Does what it sets out to do and its inexpensive.",Positive
It does what it says. It a Kyser Quick Change capo. This capo is great for changing keys in the middle of a song or anytime you are in a hurry. Highly recommended.,Positive
"It's a capo... nice fit... yet, sometimes I wonder if it fits too tightly, as when I use it, and of course the strings are tighter, sometimes I feel that playing with this particular capo makes my strings too tight...yet, it is a capo, structured very well.",Positive
I am very pleased with this purchase. The strings play very clearly with zero buzzing on any position between frets. I can dramatically hear and feel the difference than when I used a cheap $5 capo before. This is well worth your pay :),Positive
My husband usese this capo almost everytine he plays his guitar. His old one lasted about 10 years. Worth the cost.,Positive
"Long time Shubb user, but decided to try something different.I think I've found how lazy I am. I ended up using the Kyser more often than the Shubb because of the fact that you can put the Kyser on the peghead.Reaching my hand to an always available position on guitars (i.e. the peghead) for the Kyser turns out to be much more convenient than reaching to something that is not on the guitar and that could change according to situations, e.g. maybe just by my side on the sofa in my living room, maybe a table or the floor in some other places, for the Shubb.",Positive
These Capos are wonderful. Perfect all the way around! long lasting and backed up by the company. I have three!,Positive
Good strong spring and good strong materials.  The only improvement I would make is the clear protector that holds behind the neck.  The protector needs to be longer.  As the protector ages it slips off the end.  If it had more surface extended from end to the base where it pivots it would help.,Positive
"I bought this Capo for myWashburn D10. It works on my Orlando classical guitar as well. I wanted a capo that was simple to operate and wasn't too expensive - and the Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo fits the bill nicely:[Update 7/25/10: My Orlando guitar was stolen. Boo Hoo!!!]- Easy On, Easy OffThe spring mechanism makes it easy to put the capo on or take it off.- Rubberized ClampsRubberized clamps helps prevent the Kyser from scratching or marring the neck and the frets.- ErgonomicThe arched arm with the weird-looking loopy looking thingy and the other straight arm help you to firmly grab on to them without slipping so you can easily and quickly remove or reposition the Kyser Capo.- DurableThe Kyser is made from durable aluminum.[Update 7/25/10] I've had this capo for almost 3 years and it's still working like a champ! (According to Amazon's Instant Order Update for moi, I got this capo on  November 22, 2007.)- The Same Capo Colbie Caillat Used in BubblyCheck out the music video! It's the same capo Colbie Caillat used inBubbly!---The Kyser Quick Change Guitar Capo is excellent! I don't think you can go wrong with this one!",Positive
"I have owned several of these over the years and own a silver colored one presently. The price is right for these, and they work just fine. My only real issue is that sometimes, they will bunch or bend strings when setting them on whatever fret you're going to bar, thus producing a sound you weren't looking for. Some of the higher end capo's counter this by having screws and such rather than a spring. However, like i say, these work fine with a little care and attention to their placement on your fretboard, and are from what i can tell, the most popular model on the market.",Positive
"Easy to use capo. Good strength - holds the strings down well.. Not sure that it's as good as the G7th capo, which I still find is the best for holding the strings down evenly so that they stay in tune, but the Kyser is much cheaper and does a good job.",Positive
"Probably the best kapo out on the market. Very high quality and a sleek look. Easy to use, what more could you want?",Positive
"I use the capo for my guitar and it sounds awesome. I like to put the capo on the first fret and when I play a song I made, it sounds really really good. The capo is very easy to use as well.",Positive
"I really like my capo, the blue looks good with my light natural finish accoustic, and it works as it should. However, I feel like it deserves 4 stars simply because it could be a much more robust product. For example, I think the bottom part of the clamp should be a little longer, and rounded (the back side of a guitar neck is rounded, after all). The spring could definitely be tighter...I do rarely notice buzz from not quite being tight enough. Also, the design is fairly nice, but it's mostly aesthetic...it's not really super comfortable and easy to move around necessarily.Don't get me wrong, this is a rather good product, and it's priced about right. It just isn't a high end product/5-star perfect.",Positive
The package arrived on time. This is the best capo around and works great. Does what it is supposed to do.,Positive
"works great. Just clip it on and jam out.forget the screw on type, and spend the few extra bux for this one.  you'll be happier, trust me.",Positive
I chose the patriotic design for obvious reasons.  It is lovely.  Clear shard silk screening.  The capo itself is really good.  It is very snug on the strings.,Positive
"i got pink cause nobody would steal it, and we all know how often capos get stolen from people pink is great",Positive
"This capo is awesome, it looks and feels very nice and premium, it works on all of my guitars not much more you can ask for.",Positive
These Martin strings (M170) aren't bad. They just are not the sound I was looking for. I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead. The Martin's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball. Other people will love them though. They are easy to play.,Positive
"These are good for the average guitar player who doesn't want to much strain or pain on there fingers. Not the fullest tone, but you wouldn't expect that with extra light strings.",Positive
"I have an electro acoustic Martin (second hand but without a scratch). I got it with .13 strings and well, is simply too much. Is good to play rithyms but can't do pretty much nothing else.I have installed a set (I got 8) and it sounds really good. Not as solid as the .13 but now i have more range to do solos and go up and down much easier.Recomended",Positive
"Martin makes great sounding strings.  I decided to use Light Martin strings (.12) because they sounded louder and better, and I could play them just as easy as the lighter strings.",Positive
Strings are not just strings. Guitar strings are another very important part of playing GREAT Guitar. And all Martin products are second to none.,Positive
"I replaced a set of strings that were very used with these Martins.  They are, as named, very light.  They are easy on my fingers and give great tone.  Quality company, great strings, great price!",Positive
"I ordered a couple sets of this strings so I would have some extras for myself and my 6 year old son who is just starting out on guitar. this strings have good sound and hold a tune well. the best thing is the price is great. Like I said I am usinging these on mine and my sons guitar and my son was breaking string from playing to hard, but with these string it does not break the bank to replace them as needed.",Positive
"The name Martin says it all & has for many,many years.Grab some extras because you will want more, Great price,great strings.",Positive
"I love these strings, and use them for all of my acoustic playing. Best of all, I can find them here for $3.49 per set, so I'm not dumping a bunch of money on strings all the time. Easy to play, and they sound great.long lasting if you take care of them by wiping them down every time.",Positive
these strings provide a warm crisp tone that makes any dreadnought guitar sound like heaven I use them all the time,Positive
Good strings with good sound.The Extra Light is easier on the fingers - but they sound thinner too.Go for the Light gauges for more solid sound if you can handle the pressure.,Positive
"This is my third pack; the 1st pack has been using for two months, the sounds are rich and full, and the feels are still good.  I broke the high E on the 1st attempt of restringing, and luckily I had bought 2 packs at the same time.  So, I want to keep a completed pack for back up.  I have been fingerpacking for quite long time recently, sometime, i will practice for 4-5 hours+ until i'm tired for the session.  I have used light steel strings on my acoustic, but these ones are easier for fingers even just tiny lighter.",Positive
These are okay strings for the Folk Guitar.............nothing special but the price isn't out of the world either. Good buy for the money. Tried them on a Gibson J50 and they seem to do good.,Positive
"I am yet another one of those ""Forever Beginners"" when it comes to playing the guitar. Never mind that...these guitar strings made second hand guitar sound so much better! After putting in new pegs and re-stringing with these strings...it sounds so much nicer! More richer! Now I see I need to replace the saddle and bridge on it as the pegs keep coming loose. I think that once I do this and then re-string these same strings on it...I will be set to go!I like that these strings are light as due to not having had much practice for a number of years...let's face it...my fingers get sore when playing! I also have small fingers and hands.I intend to continue purchasing these same strings for future use.I recommend!",Positive
"I restrung my Martin 0-16NY with these strings and found them to be excellent.  As a new guitarist,the light strings were very easy on my sensitive finger tips and have a very warm and rich sound.",Positive
"Even though these are folk strings, I put them on my 35 year old dread and they sound really good.I hope they last longer than some of the reviews indicate.I also wipe them down after playing to minimize tarnishing.So far so good",Positive
"Great,great sound. The sound of these strings is different than any other strings you could get. They also teach a guitar player to use a lighter touch while playing to produce beautiful sounds. Well worth it.",Positive
"I love these strings.  I bought a set awhile back for my Ovation, but never used them.  Then I came into possession of an old Yamaha acoustic guitar which was pretty beat up and needed new strings.  I put these suckers on there and wow was I impressed.  Even that old beater guitar sounded great and played easily with these strings.  So... I bought another set for the Ovation this time!",Positive
I bought this pick holder because I hate putting a pick between my strings to hold it and because you can't play with a pick in your strings. I originally thought this thing would be kind of large and go all the way across the headstock. Boy was I wrong. The picture is misleading.  This thing is tiny and barely goes across three string. It wedges under neath two strings and you can put two picks (maybe more if they are thin) into the wedges on top. Stays in place well and is very convenient.Only negative is I don't know how long it will hold up. I think maybe a thicker rubber rather than this foam rubber would have held up better. I can see this thing eventually losing tension in the pick holder wedges and dropping picks.,Positive
I really like these things.  I don't stick tape and stuff to guitar body which if they do make a double sided tape similar to post it notes might be a good idea.  Bought a few while back and just bought a few more.  If you drop a pick there is another right there.  Have fun.,Positive
I love the idea that you don't need a pocket in your strap or elsewhere to store your pick. Further it will not add something else to find/loose in my pants pocket.,Positive
Excellent simple product. Fits all of my guitars and stays out the way while playing. Easily holds 2 picks at at time on each end. Has grooves on ends and one can slide it down so that at least 2 strings fit into the grooves.,Positive
Since I bought these little gadgets everybody playing guitar around want them.I use to misplace my picks all the time when playing and now I do not have to look around for them any longer as I know where to find them.  I like to use different gage picks therefore.  I have ordered more for Christmas stocking stuffers whicdh will be enjoyed by my friends.,Positive
"It's a lot smaller than the picture makes it look, but that's a good thing. It serves it purpose and fits snugly between the strings on the headstock.",Positive
"I'm using this right now on my acoustic and it does its job in respect to holding your picks. It was smaller then I would have pictured, but it still is a good product. It can hold light to heavy picks and its super easy to put it and take it off. Only problem I had was that it moves a lot when putting my pick back in. Besides that, its highly recommendable to anyone. I will definitely pick up more for my other axes.",Positive
"Not too much to say, it's made out of foam, made to slip between the strings, made to hold two picks.  I have several of these, for acoustics and for electrics.  My son lost one before during a performance on stage so it is not that secure that it won't be dislodged, still, it does stay on majority of the time.  I do recommend this.  My son's guitar teacher calls this a ""fancy little pick holder"" and I've had people ask where to buy one when they see it for the first time.  One must also be careful, my son lost one of these so I know it is a possibility of it falling off.  He lost it after performing in a play on stage.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",Positive
"I use this to hold my picks on my acoustic guitar. Got tired of losing picks in mid jam, digging through pockets, scavenging for another pick. Now it's right there.",Positive
"I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar, as I often find myself playing with fingers, then suddenly a ""pick song"" starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it, and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick, but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it, but the ""spreading strings"" on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So, still highly recommended if your headstock has a ""straight through"" design, not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )",Positive
"This thing does just what it was supposed to, i use it on my practice bass since i use any type of picks on that, and it does just what it is supposed to",Positive
"I was thinking it may affect the ability to tune properly, but it seems to have no affect at all. Super audiophile tone hounds might say it affects the resonance and sustain, but just take it off when recording. Very handy to have two picks with you at all times. It's great not to have to make a trip back to the mike stand to get a pick or having to attach something with sticky tape to the guitar's finish. Me likey!! Price can't be beat either!",Positive
"I bought one of these to try on my Asher Junior lap steel guitar to hold two finger picks and a thumb pick. Worked, but it was difficult getting all three picks in one Wedgie so I ordered a second one. Between the two of them, between the 2nd/3rd and 4th/5th strings up next to the nut, works pretty good holding these types of picks (which admittedly, the Wedgie was not actually designed for). Liked it so much I ordered two more for my acoustic and electric guitar and one for my bass (the bass version). Only down side I see is -- they DO seem loose like they could fall out AND I doubt the picks will stay in place when I case my guitar (haven't tried it yet). But otherwise, worth the price and a good doo-dad to have around. Especially if you have a lap steel and need a place to stick your finger picks on the guitar itself (real help to me staying organized!).",Positive
"I've played string instruments for the better part of 55 years... Starting with a cheap Tijuana Wood box as a 5 year old, progressing to Martin 6 and 12 string Acoustic guitars, and a few electric Fender and Gibson units.... All good in their own respect.I decided to treat myself to a Les Paul for my 58th birthday but, not having the financial resources to buy a $3,000.00 git, I shopped and shopped... Finally settling on this Cherry Burst LP-100.It arrived in perfect condition, the slightly smooshed outer packaging notwithstanding. It was even ""sorta"" in tune... but a quick dial-in with the electronic tuner brought that right.Simply put, Nice guitar. After allowing the strings and neck to settle in together, I spent a few hours a week later adjusting string height, intonation, and pick-up distances, and now this LP *ROCKS* !!!If you're going to spend mid-range $$$ on a fine practice / performance guitar, you can't go wrong with this one, kids - Two Thumbs Up ![Suggestion: A Fender Mustang 1 or 2 amp makes this guitar sound even better...]",Positive
"exactly the same as describe here, love the sound and easy to play. great price for excellent sound, highly recommend to everyone.",Positive
I bought this as a present for my daughter to learn guitar on. She absolutely loves it. Everyone that has played on it over the past few weeks loves it. You can't beat this for the price!!!,Positive
"I have been playing guitar for over 30 years. I've owned and played a variety of guitars in my lifetime. My wife bought this guitar for me as a gift. I cannot begin to tell you how much I love this guitar. It is a solid, well built guitar. The finish is beautiful. The pictures do it no justice. It sounds incredible. It has great tone and sustain, wonderful harmonics. The clean tones are nice and warm. The neck is fast. No fret noise or hums. The pickups are really nice. Its very versatile and you can play just about anything with it. From blues to hard rock & metal. I would perform live with this guitar in a heartbeat. You cannot find a better guitar for this price. I would have expected it to cost much more. I am extremely impressed with this great guitar. You can bet, when I add the next guitar to my collection, it will be another epiphone. Well done Epiphone!!",Positive
"I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again.",Positive
"I bought it 3 years ago here at amazon and I couldn't be happier.  This was my first electric and after over a year of owning it, I got a way more expensive Fender Strat and I still prefer how this Epiphone feels; it is really lightweight, a lot more that even other Les Pauls and the distance between frets is smaller than the one in other guitars I have tried, this makes it VERY easy to play, it stays in tune and it looks really REALLY lovely.I like it so much, that I decided to add a pair of Slash's Alnico IIs on it, that cost more than the guitar itself, this only made it sound incredibly awesome and improve the sustain, good ol' crunchy-bluessy rock.Call me cheap if you want and I wouldn't care, this is one of those items that makes you wonder, how come there's others way more overpriced and just don't find a way to justify that a ""real"" Gibson Les Paul will sound $800 - $1000 better.It wasn't until recently (after 3 years - I estimate somewhere around 1000 hours of heavy use) that it started fretting and that's why I gave it only 4 stars; but what would you expect from a $200 guitar...?  I'm sure this can be easily fixed by any guitar tech and it will continue been the sweet-tone machine it has always been.  If you're learning, looking for a first electric or just want a ""practice"" axe that will not dissapoint you, just go ahead and buy it, don't give it a 2nd thought and do it.",Positive
"I have been playing guitar since I was 6 years old (over 3 decades) and I must say this was a very pleasant surprise.  I haven't had an electric in years, and didn't have the budget to get a Gibson, so picked up this Epi Les Paul 100 instead, along with a Fender Mustang I Amp.  Great combination.  This guitar has a very sloid feel, and came set-up perfectly right out of the box.  All it needed was tuning.  Unlike others, I didn't feel that the strings I got needed to be changed right away, but probably within the first two weeks you will want to change them.  Replaced mine with Ernie Ball ""Not Even Slinky's"" and couldn't be happier with the way this thing plays and sounds.  Great sustain, beautiful harmonics, the clean tones are warm, can get nice blues tones out of it, and superb thrash metal too.  Very versatile.  It does not quiet do country or jazz, but it wasn't really meant to.The action is extremely easy, fret board has a great feel to it, good width on the neck, not too slinder but not too thick.  It just feels good in your hands.The finish on this product is very nice.  One thing though, the pick guard is kind of a tan / cream off white color, not bright white as pictured, but it still looks great.Also, not mentioned in the description, but this does come with a 12 foot cord, but it's not the best quality.  Would recommend picking up a new one when you order.Overall, this is well worth the $500 that they list as the MSRP.  At less than half that its a steal.If you are considering this instrument, don't hesitate.",Positive
"Well, the Epiphone Les Paul came in earlier this morning!Am I impressed? U bet cha!This thing is simply beautiful! It arrived well padded in a double box. Initially, I spent a few minutes going over the whole guitar with a magnifier to see if I could spot any flaws. NONE! Not a finger print on it anywhere! This guitar is extremely well made and put together right. It was in tune out the box and the action is smooth as butter. The neck is slim (which is good for my thick hands) and the jumbo frets have no burrs or other abnormalities. I put a quarter under the 10th. fret and it's right on the &#34;money&#34;!It's considerably heaver than than I thought.  I would imagine it weighs about 10-14lbs. I have a strap ordered and on the way.The maple top is a work of art with a superior finish. All the metal hardware appears top quality as are the Duncan pickups. This Epiphone is a lot easier to play than any thing I ever had.  Your hand floats over the frets!I don't think you could get a better piece for the price point.",Positive
"This is one awesome guitar!  I also purchased the Fender Mustang I Amp, Epiphone custom case (fits like a glove) and Planet Waves Planet Lock Leather Guitar Strap (comfortable and very secure) which made for an UNBELIEVEABLE combination along with Rocksmith 2014.  I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this combination.  The only problem in my household is....who gets to play next.",Positive
"Waited two months before reviewing my les paul 100 to make sure there were no issues.  I am very happy with the guitar.  It came well padded and was in excellent shape.  It was set up well and has played well out of the box.  Just did my first string change making sure I used the same gauge of string and didn't have to make any adjustments to the guitar.  Played as well after the change as it did before.  Was a little nervous about an online purchase and not being able to play the guitar before buying but when you live out in the sticks and it's a major trip to get to a real guitar store you sometimes take your chances.  Anyway it all worked out as the guitar is very easy to play, free prime two day shipping, no sales tax, and saved about $80 in gas it would have taken to make a trip to buy one in a store.  The savings in gas and tax paid for about half of my new Mustang 2 v2 amplifier.The only thing is on the epiphone site it states all their electric guitars include a cable in the box.  This one did not and from reading their forum it seems it is almost a normal thing for cords to somehow disappear before reaching the customer.  It is not a big deal to me but I thought I'd mention it for those thinking of buying a epiphone.  When I ordered this one I wasn't really sure if a cable would be included or not so I ordered one at the same time, I'm glad I did.",Positive
"First off, the shipping was fantastic. It shipped the very next day and came VERY well protected in perfect condition. It is an extremely well made and solid product. I think a few people have given this Les Paul a rep of just being a ""Starter Guitar"". Trust me when I say, I have no problem leaving my Les Paul Standard at home and taking this one to a gig. It plays well and the sound?? INCREDIBLE. It even has a great acoustic sound to it when not plugged into an amp. I can't say enough good things about this guitar it's that good. If you're thinking aout buying this guitar, don't. Just buy it!! BUY IT!!",Positive
"It'd been about 6 years since I've had an electric guitar. I traded my old one off to pay a debt and just never returned. I decided recently after moving back to my home town that I was going to get back into playing electric guitar, only this time I wanted it to be more than a &#34;hobby&#34;. I fully intend on doing local gigs for fun and some side cash and this guitar will EASILY deliver.It came in perfect condition. The action is set perfectly and I don't have any issues with buzzing strings. It comes with clear (black) control knobs, which I'll likely replace with something a bit prettier. But overall this is a great guitar. It even sounds amazing, it really does have that ballsy sound of a LP..... because well 0_o it IS a LP. Its no Gibson, but it IS a LP!Very happy with this purchase!!!!",Positive
"Purchased primarily for Rocksmith and it works very well for that.  Still learning how to play, but like the feel of this guitar.  Looks great and plays great.  Was packaged very well.  Only needed minor setup adjustments. I would recommend getting strap locks.",Positive
"I am editing my previous review on this little guitar after taking the time to properly set it up, dial it in and play it for a while.  I edited yet again as someone didn't appreciate my ""gloating"" over other guitars I own.  Sorry to offend YOU.I made a knee jerk review (again) right after I got this.  But in all fairness I received my Gibson Les Paul on the same day, buying IT from my local music store and professionally set up, ready to go.  I was comparing apples and oranges, so to speak.  But now, even after comparing them to each other, they really aren't that far apart.The Gibson is the best guitar I've ever owned and made my previous comparison based on it.  But this little baby is now my second favorite.My other review was NOT FAIR!!!!!!  I paid a lot more for the Gibson and 149 bucks for this Epiphone.  Dollar for dollar this little Ephiphone is a steal!!!!  WOW!!!I must honestly admit, the edge goes to my Gibson, but not by as much as you'd think.  This little Epiphone is an outstanding guitar, regardless of price.  If I were to play them each blindfolded I would never guess one was $149 guitar, ever!  The tone of the Epiphone is much like the Gibson Les Paul.  It's easy to play, comfortable and has a sweet sound.  I can either rock out with it or mellow out and play the blues or classic rock.To be honest, I will probably play this Epiphone a LOT more than the Gibson.  After all, if I ding this one up I haven't broke the bank.  I think I'll tend to use this one a lot more than the other.I am very happy with this Epiphone Les Paul and will proudly play and OWN it.  I am amazed they can make this thing for the money they charge.  I may purchase another one and put it away as I'm sure the price won't stay this low.  PLUS, I'll get another one in a different color!!  You can never have too many guitars..  I am going to an a pickguard to this one.  The finish on it is outstanding and I'd like to keep it that way.If I were thinking of learning to play the guitar, this one is a no-brainer....BUY IT!!!If you're an established player looking for a really nice practice guitar, I'd buy this one is a heartbeat.  I was shocked at how sweet it sounds, how good it looks, how comfortable and light it is and how well it plays.  Sure it was way out of tune and required a few height adjustments but now it is FANTASTIC.New rule for me, no writing reviews until I own the product for at least one week!!!!!",Positive
"this is a beautiful guitar...the finish is amazing...and the tone is very clear...if you can't afford several hundreds or thousand for a les paul...this is a fun and very good guitar for the money...has 6 strings,,,from e to e...and if you know the g chord you will have lot's of fun...the volume control goes to 11 ,if you want to kick it up a notch...(only kidding)",Positive
"Epiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, EbonyHello again. I have written a review on this guitar just after I purchased it and now it's been over a year and I still stand by my positive review. I own about 8 guitars now and this guitar is one of two of my favorites. My other favorite is a Dean electric 12 string.  When I hold and play this Epiphone Les Paul special 2 guitar it feels and sounds like something I could take on stage but it doesn't have the cost associated with a Gibson. What's also amazing is that it's still around a $150. It's well worth the noney. It stays in tune and it high quality. Well worth the money. I just purchased an electric/acoustic Epiphone ukelele today for my Chiropractor. I will review that later. If you are looking for a Les Paul guitar this is not one. Not his typical style although Amazon does sell one for about $250 so don't let the name fool you. It's still a very nice guitar though. Very solid construction and a beautiful polished ebony finish and tuners. I highly recommend this guitar. Buy it!  Thank you.",Positive
"I've been playing for over 40 years. I currently own 60 or so guitars. My problem with LP's is they feel like a boat anchor around your neck, I've bought and sold quite a few. Another problem with real LP's, you only get one chance to drop one, just see how many used ones have head-stock repairs. They ARE beautiful guitars but not comfy for me to play. I deal in used guitars, picked up an Epi Special ll along with several other guitars at a resale shop for very cheap. I didn't mess with it until I was ready to set it up for resale. I fully expect to do a fret level on most guitars, even a lot of higher end guitars need it. I found on the Special ll the frets were actually very well done (Chinese version from 2011) and only needed a slight leveling (would have played fine without it but I am very picky). It didn't take much to get it set up, small truss rod adjustment, new set of 10's for strings. little bit of adjustment to the bridge, cut the nut a bit....note it played well the way I got it, just like my stuff perfect. Got it set-up and plugged it in to check the electronics and that's when I started to really become impressed with this guitar. Cheap pickups are supposed to sound muddy with no character, these sounded pretty good, actually very good, nice and bright with a nice tight bottom end. I check sound also by cranking up a backing track to stage level and playing a few tracks. It cut through really well. I noticed while doing this test that the volume had a very nice sweep to it and didn't lose any highs when turned down. The tone knob was also very usable with a good sweep, very nice. I popped off the back cover to check what was in there, full sized pots, maybe not the best quality but much better than expected. I normally upgrade electronics on my personal guitars to get the controls to operate the way I like but no need to fix what's not broken. Yup, I said ""on my personal guitars"" because I am keeping this one for myself. The neck is very fast and comfy, it's NOT a boat anchor so my shoulder will thank me. The tuners are the lower end trapezoid type but turn smoothly with no backlash and keep the guitar in tune fine, once again if it ain't broke don't fix it. Please note that most tuning problems are from a binding improperly cut nut. I've set-up hundreds of guitars and almost all of them need nut work, doesn't matter what price point you are at. This also has a bolt on neck. A lot of players say you have to have a set (glued) neck. I feel glue actually deadens the sound a bit, I prefer a good solid bolt on to transfer sound, IMO. I have found that the quality level of the low end foreign guitars has become very good. I know that corners have to be cut to get to the price point of these budget guitars but all in all the Special ll is good to go right out of the box with just a little tweaking. My advice is to go try one, my taste may not be the same as yours. There are a lot of good value well made guitars now-a-days, I just found at this price vs quality ratio the Epiphone Special ll really is special. Get one, get it set up for a few bucks if you can't do it yourself, and you will have a good instrument. Oh did I mention this is a very good looking guitar?",Positive
"If you are considering this guitar, I have to assume you're shopping for an electric guitar at the lower end, not trying to decide between this and a Gibson Les Paul Custom.  It is in the category of beginner/intermediate guitars that I rate this a 5 star instrument.I really couldn't find anything ""wrong""  with it.  Yes, it has shortcomings as compared to the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls, such as having only two controls for volume and tone, rather than four, which also means it has a slightly different look that the famous Gibson.  But you weren't planning to try to fool anyone, were you?  Beginning players would be well advised to focus on developing their skills and honing technique, rather than fussing around with tone controls anyway.The sound is good, and I found the appearance and finish of mine to be just fine.  The pickups are surprisingly good.  The same electronics are found on some of the more expensive Epiphone Les Pauls.  It was no great surprise to find that the strings are no good, although it would sure be nice if they didn't cut corners on such an inexpensive component that is also integral to sound quality.As for fit and finish, reading the reviews has convinced me that there is a lot of variation in both, and it is luck of the draw whether you get one that was made on a Monday after a long weekend of partying.  For several reasons, if I had this to do over, I would not buy it online (nor would I buy it from GC).  Better to inspect the actual guitar you'll be buying, and don't be shy about asking them bring out another one if you don't like the first one you see.I discovered too late that my local music shop would have sold me this guitar for about the same price, but they would have included a full professional setup, including string change.  You are likely to find a similar deal where you live, because the smaller shops are having to do more and more to compete with the Internet and GC.As it is, I took my guitar to the local shop and paid for a setup.  It had some intonation problem, the action was too high, and as others have commented, the strings on this guitar need to be changed immediately.  I asked the luthier his opinion of the tuners, as I'd read a lot of people trashing the tuners.  Bearing in mind that he had a financial incentive to steer me toward replacing them, he instead assured me that they were fairly decent, and advised against changing them unless a problem develops.Out of the box, I was a little unsure of my purchase.  However, now that it's been fully set up  and new strings installed, I am quite pleased with this guitar.  I don't believe you will find a better guitar, or even close, at this price level.I did a lot of shopping, and considered guitars up to $500 for my first foray into electric.  I was tempted to go with something more expensive, on the theory that in a couple years, I'll want to upgrade anyway.  Now I'm glad I chose this one.  For one thing, this is a guitar I'll always enjoy having around.  There is nothing cheap or toy-like about it.  In 2-3 years, my tastes may change.  I may want something completely different down the road, and now I still have that option.  Had I gone with a more expensive model, I'd feel locked in.  No good!BOTTOM LINE:  If you're shopping for a guitar in this price range, I think you'll be pleased with this guitar.  Buy it locally so you can see the exact guitar you're buying, and negotiate to have a setup included, because it will almost certainly need one.  Have it set up right, install some quality strings, and you'll be very happy with the Epiphone LP Special II.",Positive
"Pretty sweet guitar for the price. Sounds like and plays like a Les Paul. I really like the vintage sunburst color (It's more orange than what the picture shows). The strings were setup on the nut close to the fret board the way I like it already when I got it. I just replaced the strings with heavier strings for personal preference. Overall, sounds and looks awesome! Would recommend it for anyone on a budget that wants the sound of a Les Paul.",Positive
"My axesEpiphone LP Studio deluxe plustopFender MarauderTakamine G320Squier Standard StratSquier Standard PJ bassBeen playing 20 years.I had a Squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar I didn't care about that I could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with. But it got old and I wore the frets out so I needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith. I picked up the LP special 2 in black at Guitar Center for $130 and they kicked in free strings.Bought it for a game, but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good, played so well, and had a killer tone.My LP Studio had it's pickups replaced with the Zakk Wylde 81/85's which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have. Imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain, tone, and playability. Considering this thing is almost the same prices a Bullet Squier, it is easily twice the guitar for that price. You literally cannot find a better guitar for $150 than the Special 2.....Sound: 5/5Two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs, deep lows, and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound.The pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect.The pickups are high output and feel like AlNico more than Ceramic. Not sure which they have.So much sustain for a bolt on neck. I was shocked.Build Quality 4/5I did have 1 problem with the high E tuner. I didn't notice in the store but the string peg was 1/4"" up out of the headstock. When I discovered this I loosened the string, whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way.Intonation required no adjustment.Action was exactly the way I like itNeck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow.The finish was perfect. No nicks, blemishes, just oily black goodness.Neck was flush with no gaps or seams, and professionally shimmed. Damn good for a bolt on.Hardware is typical for the price but does the job, stays in tune very well.Back bending headstock and 3x3 orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable.The bridge is similar to my LP Studio with the tunamatic setup. Individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts, IE can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings.Weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but I soon got used to it. No pickguard and it doesn't need one. Lots of relief between strings and body. You won't find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick. Makes it easy to clean too!Truss rod is behind a nice body color plate.Frets were smooth, rounded, and played nice. Could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough.Neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to. I would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top, soon got used to it and it wasn't an issue.500k pots and side body 1/4 TRplug keeps the cable out of the way.Overall 5/5Came with hex keys for setupCame with an awsome poster with all the Epiphone guitar modelsCame with a nice bumper stickerNo manualBody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks, about the same as any other $150 guitar.Summary: This guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument I own. It sounds good enough to gig with out of the box. IT's well built, plays well, and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music. The frets are medium jumbo's and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re-fretting than a typical Affinity or Bullet (2 squiers in this price range).I would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music. I did blues, metal, country, and pop. The pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a Fender, not as much of those nice Fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity.One thing I like about Epiphones and Gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge. This makes it VERY easy to palm mute and play with high gain. I lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my Strats the damn volume knob is in the way.As an experiment I took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if I could get a single coil sound out of it. What happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got EVERYWHERE. The tone was a little brighter and output a little lower, still no hum but you wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil. I ended up putting the screws back in.I will likely put my LP Studio stock pickups back in (hell yeah coil tapping here I come!) and move my EMG 81/85's in this LP Special 2 and make myself a nice little metal guitar.Do yourself a favor, buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar. It's cheap enough that you won't care if you bang it around a little, and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many years.",Positive
"This guitar is very attractive looking, and plays well right out of the box.  I am a beginner guitarist, so please take this review for what it's worth.  I am extremely pleased, and don't plan on ever upgrading.  This guitar is a darker cherry red wood color in the center than shown in the picture.  So expect it to be a different color than what you order.  See customer pics.It comes with strings installed and almost tuned.  The volume knob is well designed for smooth and convenient use.  The tremble and rhythm switch is far enough out of the way that you're not going to accidently hit it while strumming.  My only gripe is that the high E string gets caught on the top pickup when I'm playing hard, but maybe I'm just a novice.  I will say that it's very easy to play.Everything on it is very adjustable which I also like.  The only BUYER BEWARE statement I can think of is: you're going to be addicted to it!",Positive
"I purchased this when it was on sale during the Christmas season - I figured that for the asking price at the time I could not go wrong.My expectations were frankly low. I had heard nothing but horrible things about Epiphones, with the main complaint being they would not stay in tune. Other complaints included poor overall quality and terrible playability. What I received was the polar opposite: I received an instrument with a strikingly beautiful finish, and one that stays in tune (amazingly it was close to being in perfect tune when I unboxed it.)I am not wild about the strings that came stock, but I am a drummer and suffer the same disappointment about heads that ship with new drums. I guess guitarists expect to change strings on a new guitar the same way drummers do when it comes to heads. In the near future I intend to restring the guitar withD'Addario ECG25 Chromes Flat Wound Electric Guitar Strings, Light, 12-52, which, while thick, should make the instrument jazz-friendly. I realize that flatwound strings will require a new set-up and intonation, but considering how good the guitar is and how relatively little it cost me, the new strings and work will be an investment.Out of the box, though, the action was reasonably low and the frets appeared [to my novice eyes and fingers] to be properly dressed. I have already invested in a good - but not great case:Guardian Hardshell Electric Guitar Caseto store the guitar (I also uploaded a customer-provided photo on this page that shows the case and how well the guitar fits.)For the record, I use the following amp, which I have also reviewed that is a perfect match to this guitar:Kustom Defender 15 Watt Class A Guitar Headthat I run through aKustom  The Defender 1 x 12 Guitar Extension Cabinet for 5H Head.Bottom line: this is a great instrument for beginners and not a bad one for experienced players. The price is right, and the quality clearly shows that off shore manufacturers have made significant improvements over the past year.",Positive
"Listen,If you want an inexpensive guitar with great sound and easy playability, buy this one.  Period.I bought a black one to leave in the trunk while I was at work, in case the guys called for a practice session, so I wouldn't have to go all the way home to pick up my gear.I have other, way more expensive guitars, like a Gibson ES-335, Dean 12 string, and a Fender Strat, but I gotta tell you, I like this one soooo much I play it more than the others!  No kidding.And if it gets banged up, so what???  It costs a buck thirty!  Buy another.  In facte I bought 2 others with different finishes, just for a cheap change up guitar.Dig it.",Positive
"I'm updating a previous negative review. I had some issues with this guitar when it arrived. I couldn't get it setup, the action was very high and I couldn't set the intonation. Notes at the 12th fret were very sharp, and I couldn't lower them with saddle adjustments. I missed one vital checkpoint, the bridge needed to be lowered. Setup is finished, and I can now agree with most reviewers. For the price, this guitar is far better than any others in the price range. I know my grandson will enjoy it, at least for awhile. If it ends up as a dust collector, I'm not out much on the purchase price. I'll add it back to my own collection, and upgrade the electronics.",Positive
"I purchased this guitar after much thoughtful consideration of other possibilities, but the nearly universal high marks for this particular make and model finally persuaded me to go with this one, and I do not regret that decision.First of all, it is a beauty. Initially, I was a little disappointed in that very little wood grain shows through the orangish finish. (My guitar was made in China, which may account for the darker hue.) I thought I had wanted a lighter color, but the more I look at it the happier I am with what I have. Second, this instrument is no light-weight, either in heft or playability. It is solidly constructed, very well put together, and plays like a dream. (I lowered the action until I encountered some fret buzz, then backed off the adjusting screws just a bit; that's basically the only adjustment I've made, or likely will make.)It's been barely a day since the guitar arrived and, as yet, I've only played it unplugged. I can't wait to hear how it sounds amped up.",Positive
"I have been playing for about 7 years now and have a Tak Jasmine Acoustic and a Jay Turser Strat knockoff.  I really love the Les Paul sound but my pocket book is not large enough for the Les Paul price.  I've read just about everything I can on these Epi's and finally went to my local Music store to try one out.  My initial impression was somewhat mixed.  The sound was good but the action seemed ""off""  After playing a few scales and a couple easy chords I began to get a feel fro the action on this guitar.  Then I switched from the rear pickup to the front and BANG there was that sound I was looking for.  Classic Gibson Les Paul sound (in all fairness the amp was setup for a strat).  After playing around a bit more I asked to try one in the cherry finish.  They unboxed a new one for me and WOW this guitar looks AMAZING!  I sat down plugged it in and played a bit. Instantly I was in love.  The action was perfect (despite the some what heavier strings than what I'm used to).  The sound off both humbuckers was classic and playability of this guitar has to be tried to be appreciated.  Tuning is a breeze, and is held as well as any other guitar I own (I always retune before every session anyway).  Epiphone really did everything to capture that Les Paul sound in a economy guitar.  Yes I know you puriest will point to the bolt on neck, the cheaper humbuckers, the flat top construction, and the basswood body.  I point to the angled headstock, mahagony neck, rosewood fret board, and Gibson electronics.  I love the simple volume and tone controls (yea a little more knob spinning when switching between pickups) and the tun-o-matic bridge and tail piece is gonna make string changes a breeze (so much better than having the try to thread thru the body).  Even with my somewhat limited practice amp this guitar still sounds amazing, oh and the sustain from it well lets just say I hit a low E last night before I went to bed, and I think it is still reviberating in the amp this morning (lol  If your looking for a Les Paul sound at a discount price- consider this your answer. Oh and my local shop was able to give me this guitar at $20 less than any place else, AND they will do a FREE setup for me after I've played it for a while (so far it's been perfect out of the box).",Positive
"Wow, you would have thought this was the Holy Grail when it arrived at my house.  My son practically ran to the UPS man when the truck pulled up.  He is thrilled with this guitar.  Great purchase.",Positive
"I got this guitar at Guitar Center, i was scared to get this guitar from amazon because of a review saying it looked like a toy, so i wanted to see it in person, i saw it, i tested it out at guitar center and it was amazing, its better than my other les paul special ii, this guitar plays great, its set up very nicely, the pickups are very nice, the electronics work perfectly, i have no problems with it, but the guitar is very beautiful, i would highly recommend getting it, i just dont know if anyone elses will be the same, not all guitars are made the same right?",Positive
"A friend showed up at our monthly guitar club meeting with this and I loved having an on/off switch right at my fingertips. Genius!I bought 2 immediately. The shorter one goes from my guitar to the pedal board and the longer one from the pedal board to the amp. Works like a charm and no excuse now for damaging amps or ears.Two issues to consider. The right angle plug was a mm or 2 short of being able to stick into my Tele and my Takamine. It would not seat properly and would slide out. I had to turn the cord around and use the right angle on the pedal board side, where it worked, but now the switch is &#34;down there&#34;. I don't think Planet Waves is the first connector that I had a problem with that so I dont blame them, but maybe stick with the straight jack if you are not sure. Second issue is simply that these little button-switches are fussy. You have to make sure you have it in the right position by looking at them - feel wont do. (If you see the white edge they are &#34;quiet&#34;)",Positive
"This is my third circuit breaker cable. I play in church and no one wants to here the ""POP"" if I have to leave the sanctuary. Why three: 10foot, 15foot, and 20foot depending on the setup for the group - I hate cable jump rope. I really like the right angle connector makes it fit no matter what guitar stand I use.",Positive
I love this cable. It is perfect for making guitar changes without noise. The cable itself does not seem quite as good quality as my other Planet Waves cables but it is still better than most others. The switch is easy to use.,Positive
"So far I am a very satisfied customer with this cable.  For what is worth, while I have used these cables before, this is the first one I have ever owned, so I am no expert.",Positive
"A nice concept that actually works, The cable is very nice, too with an adequate gauge. Try it out for yourself!",Positive
"Wow, these cables are made really sturdy. And the noiseless feature is priceless. Definitely a real good value for the money.",Positive
30 feet of cable for what I paid for a 10 footer from my local guitar shop.I highly recommend!,Positive
I'd chose this cable cause I own an older one with the angle plug and needed another longer cable with the straight end. I like the idea that you can cut the power  and remove the cable from the instrument with having  mute the amp or mixer. I recommend this product to anyone who likes the ability to disconnect without doing anything else.,Positive
"I purchased this for my pedalboard a few years ago, and have always loved it. I only use 3-4 pedals, and this is always one of them. It sounds great, is indestructable, and takes up almost no space. The controls are great, and you can get a large variety of sounds. I have played ""boutique"" chorus pedals, and the Boss is loads better in every way. You will not regret this purchase.Pros:-easy to use-no hum-small-sonds awesome-indestructabecons:-NONEIf you want an awesome chorus that has been around forever, will last forever, and sounds incredible, get this.",Positive
"I bought this little pedal back in 1996, about a year after I got my first guitar.  I've tried other pedals, but ultimately, this one gives me the best sound.  It's very versatile and it's really easy to dial in just about any sound I want.  You might get a more dramatic effect from expensive rack units, but for cost and practicality, this pedal is your best bet!",Positive
Very very good product! I have no complains about it.  Definitely a great buy and a Must have in your pedalboard.,Positive
"First, let me start by saying this pedal has been part of my setup for nearly 7 years now and still looks/sounds as great as the day it came out of the box.Its a Boss product, which means you are going to pay for what you get.  You get the best bang for your buck with Boss products.  Solid, rugged construction that is built to last (no chance of breaking one of these things) and an outstanding analog stomp box with a genuine sound.  Good customer support as well and if you ever feel you need to sale your Boss pedal, resale prices are always good.While this pedal is capable of hundreds of tones and sounds (chorus is one of the most useful and versatile effects in my opinion)  Here are some of the best uses I have found.1. Tweak the pedal just to thicken your sound and give that 2 guitar effect.  Perfect if you want to fatten up that really heavy chorus in a song and make it sound really full.2. Dime out the speed and depth for those crazy out of this world Korn type effects.  This is a really handy pedal for imitating tones of other bands because it can do so much.  There are a lot of bands tones I can come close to exactly matching, tones that took them 2 or 3 pedals to achieve.3.  Liquify your sound and give a beautiful tone to cleans and leads.  This pedal will help simple parts that would normally go unoticed stand out.  If you play any kind of Christian music you will soon learn it doesn't matter what you do as long as you put chorus on it.  Walking in on Sunday morning and turn out some Slayer while using a chorus pedal and they will go nuts.  Chorus is just one of those effects no matter what type of music you are playing, you will always find a use for it, so there is no excuse for not adding this pedal to your rig.In addition you have some great features, easy access battery compartment, accepts a 9v power supply, works well with both guitar and bass, 2 out puts so you can run to 2 sources if desired, and all the controls you need to really be in complete control.  You HAVE to get this pedal!",Positive
"Sweet chorus, I have the CE5, the CE20, a CE3 and this one. This chorus is my favorite, it sounds just right, the analog CE3 is awesome but too weak, Boss should include a level knob instead of a stereo control, anyway this one is a keeper!",Positive
"OK... I am a pro musician & rely on gear that will stand the tests of the road. I was using an old Ibenez Chorus Pedal (one of the first to hit the market) of which I did not use much basically due to it's used for certain songs. I upgraded from using 2 separate pedal boards to a single unit & decided to buy the Boss CH-1 Super Chorus to add to the collection. After my first gig I removed the Ibenez Chorus Pedal because of the tonal superiority of the Boss unit. I am certain there are units that may boast of being better but, I have found through my 40+ years of playing that more money is not always better.Great tones! Easy operation! And it is the best bet for the money!",Positive
"I like the product a lot. For me, the only problem is the time of the ""sustainer effect"".It is not so long as I thought. I though it would be like the piano's sustainer. But it's a good pedal effect. My guitar get a good sound with the ""attack effect"". Thank you.",Positive
"As several of the previous posters astutely mentioned, 'you will need a noise gate to use this pedal'. I completely agree with that. And it will sustain your notes. It will actually raise the volume to make them sustain. But you will have extraneous hiss when the guitar is not playing to cover it up. The only way to get rid of this hiss is to use a noise gate. I use the NS-2 when I use my chain of pedals. That said, this pedals has some wonderful uses. Every note will have the same volume. You can hit the chord as hard as you like or as softly and it will play at the same volume. You can set it to sustain for days. Again, you will need a noise gate. There is nothing transparent about THIS compressor as there is almost all of my other compressors, but none of them are as ""ACTIVE"" as this one. Perhaps that's the price you pay for what this pedal can do. I recommend messing with it quite a while. You can do some incredible funk, jazz, metal vibes out of it.",Positive
"Man this is perfect! Some people says that the cs3 is noisy but I thinks that depends on what type of electric conections you got at home or place you play, if you don't have a independent circuit for your pedalboard there's gonna be a lot of noise, most of all bcuz of the compression (obviously)... For me this is PERFECT, doesn't make any noise with my conections... Tottally recommend this!",Positive
"The Boss CS3 is right for me, I have been using it with excellent results, I have many compressors, Line6, MXR, Behringer, Digitech, and although I alternate their use the Boss stands out on many rig configurations, it can feel a little bit overcompressed sometimes but in general a very good product, I highly recommended it as your main compressor, if you dont like it probably you dont know how to configure it, good luck.",Positive
"It really pains me to give anything but a 5-star review to a BOSS product, since I'm such a big fan of their product line and build quality overall.  Those compliments apply equally to the CS-3 Compression Sustainer.  And it does do the job reasonably well without me having to worry about putting a less-reliable brand in my signal chain.However, there are some minor issues with this pedal that you need to know.  The two most common complaints that I see are that it adds ""noise"" to your amp and that it changes the tone a bit.  The former complaint is probably true, though if you're enough of a hobbyist to use a Compression Sustainer, you're probably already contemplated using a noise gate/suppressor, such as the BOSS NS-2.  Problem solved.As for the latter complaint (changes tone), that's also true, but it's not necessarily a bad thing if you LIKE the tone that results.  The whole point of the CS-3 is that it's supposed to cut out the extremes of your tone and sustain it.  This can result in a muddy, ""neutered"" tone, though you can play with the TONE and other settings to help it.  I also find that with the settings all at 12 O'Clock, the output is too quiet compared to other pedals at default settings.Really, while BOSS pedals are considered to be ""expensive"" compared to many of the other effects out there, the CS-3 should really be viewed as a ""budget"" or ""entry level"" compressor, when you consider that most of the quality compressors are either in rack units or something like a Keeley Compressor costing north of $200.  The best thing you can say about the BOSS (even compared to the similarly-priced MXR options) is that the CS-3 gives you a great deal of control over your compression for a reasonable price.  The biggest negative of the pedal, in my opinion, is that the resulting sound might seem a little too...compressed.But there are a lot of things you could do with a CS-3, and it works best paired with other pedals (chorus, delay, some distortions) that you're trying to smooth out.  Ultimately, it's a pedal that could have been better, though there aren't too many significantly better alternatives until you get north of $100 anyway.",Positive
"As a pro musician, I am always on a quest for better tone to expand and comply with different gig situations. I had a bad experience with a few Compression Pedals through my years only to toss them in the closet & give up on the thought.When I upgraded my pedal board, I decided to give the idea of adding a Compression unit to give my G&L; American Legacy (Stratocaster style guitar) more sustain at lower volumes. Boss is the company that dominates my effects board... I rely on their Chormatic Tuner, Digital Delay (2 of them), Line Switch & Direct Box almost every night (for gig & Practice).With a somewhat negative attitude going into this I had a great surprise to find that I really, really like this unit. It did what I wanted & then some! Great tone & sustain oozes from this little box & stays in the ""On"" position for most of the time I am playing my electric guitars, especially any Stratocaster styled guitar I own.",Positive
"Guitarists have become a bunch of cork-sniffers. There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless ""boutique"" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to ""stock"" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, I don't need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I haven't owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it's ""old school"" rock distortion. The usual ""may not appeal to metalheads"" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap ""boutique"" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I'd considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.  I couldn't be happier.",Positive
"Think of this as an artist's tool.  And for every job there is the 'right' tool.  Is this the best distortion pedal?  That really depends on what sound you are trying to get and what other gear/technique you are using with it.  If you are using bad gear or poor technique it will not perform miracles.  It will not make your 15 watt solid state Ibanez Soundblaster amp sound like a raging Orange Rockerverb and it will not make single coils sound like EMG 81/85s.  But arguing over what pedal is 'best' is like two painters arguing over what color is best used to paint a sunrise.  This pedal is good for a tight kind of distortion- but not so heavy that you can do modern metal if running into a clean amp - if that makes any sense. It it doesn't make sense, there are ample Youtube reviews you can check out before pulling the trigger.  It has been used by professional players like Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, and Kurt Cobain. It is a professional pedal used by professional musicians.  It's built like a brick and durable as all get-out.  I found mine used for $20, but the new asking price is fair. I would like to see Boss start using true bypass instead of the buffered bypass they use, but admittedly I don't detect any tonesuck with it.  I've run mine into a tube amp on the verge of breakup and it can really get things cooking.  It also takes an overdrive or sustainer pretty well to bump the gain and get some singing leads.  With the exception of 'modeler' type pedals from companies like Tech 21, I do not think that any dirtboxes- this included- perform optimally when run into a solid state amp.  So if you are not happy with the way it is distorting your Marshall MG, the problem is in your amp.",Positive
"I have had this pedal for about 15 years, just replaced the old one a month ago. It distorts sound, not quite the way you would imagine though. This effect sounds really good through a fat cab or a larger amp that can let the cabinet give the tone a little color. I use it through a Epiphone Valve Jr and a Marshall 2x12 stack with JTM45 on top and its fine. This thing through a Champ or smaller amp will not give you the meat you are probably looking for without a EQ pedal.This does just what it says it does. One Volume knob, one tone, and one distortion knob. CRANK IT.",Positive
This pedal is a must have for any pedal board. I love the overdriven sound of this pedal in that it has a distortion element but not so distorted single notes are lost in the fray. Thirty some odd years and counting and still one of the best.,Positive
"This was the first pedal I ever bought when I started playing guitar 15 years ago.  It's still in my primary set up!  The sound it puts out is very balanced:  you can get a subtle overdrive-like sound out of it, or a high-gain hard rock/80's metal sound out of it.  For those looking for insane crunch, this isn't for you.  Anyone that wants a nice, versatile pedal, this IS the one you want!",Positive
"This is a distortion pedal. It will give your amp a boost for solos and turn a clean amp into a dirty girl. It's pretty harsh in tone - kind of a white noise distortion. The DS-1 DOES NOT warm up the tone in your amp. You can dial the tone in, but it's a pretty harsh sounding.That said - the DS-1 does exactly what I wanted it to. My amp gives me a nice warm crunch, classic rock style. The DS-1 gives me the 80's metal and punk rock sound I wanted, and it does so flawlessly.It took me about 5 minutes of tinkering to get a nice transition from my amp to a matching tone on the DS-1. It's BOSS, so it will last forever.Th only drawback is that it's an item that is currently cheaper elsewhere. Usually Amazon catches up with that sort of thing, but word to the wise, don't pay more than $40 new for this thing.",Positive
"I find that if I play this pedal along with my Boss Super Chorus pedal, my guitar with Tex-Mex pickups captures a lot Gilmour's sound tonality.",Positive
"This pedal has been on the market for a very long time and it was a smoking deal for a Boss pedal at $40. The pedal works great with almost any guitar pickup set but sings with my EMG powered Schecter and tube amp.Different distortion levels can be dialed in and to my surprise, it works good with a bass although bass players know they will lose some bottom end.The guitar universe always raves about Boss and the distortion pedals and how any guitar player should have one of the distortion pedals. Buy it and experiment with the gain and settings and find your favorite tone.I may buy another one and mod it to use with my bass.",Positive
"This is a little more expensive than some other brands, but i think it sounds great and it's way more durable than a plastic pedal.I'm pretty new to electric guitar so i'm not really a distortion and tone expert like some other reviewers.  To me this this sounds better and is easier to adjust than my modeling amp, so I think it's a good purchase.",Positive
This is the best deal ever my first pedal was a zoom 505 gfx and it was really electronic and synthesized sounding alot of echos and stuff. Honestly the best effect it held was the phaser/jet pipe effect. I got this today and man it sounds so crisp clean and evenly distorted. It does the job distortion and sustain best buy for a best price!! bodow!!! from Trinidad!!,Positive
I love these pedals. Inexpensive to purchase - easy to mod to your liking.This pedal received the gain and JCM mod.I will purchase more of these and will mod each and every one of them.This pedal is also good stock for a lead boost. Love this pedal.,Positive
"There's some element of nostalgia with the DS-1 that I've just never understood.  I know they're cheap.  I know they're incredibly durable (as are all BOSS pedals).  I know everybody had one or tried one at some point, and Kurt Cobain (apparently) used them with his Fenders.But I also know that I've almost never been happy with the tone I get when I step on the pedal.  It's incredibly thin and harsh, and lacks proper sustain, even cranked all the way.  I've used it on Marshall solid state amps and Vox tube amps.  Fender single coil pickups and guitars with humbuckers.  You can mess with the TONE and DIST dials all you want, but there has to be dozens of other affordable pedals, and even on-amp distortion, with a richer, deeper tone.Coincidentally, I also used the BOSS OS2 Overdrive/Distortion for many years, which is supposedly merges/blends a DS-1 with an OD-1.  That pedal isn't ideal either, but if I turn the knob all the way to ""distortion"", it's a much better tone than I ever got out of a DS-1.Then again, it is very dependable and usually only $40 (or less), so I can't really give it a bad review because it probably does belong in everyone's collection.  That just doesn't mean you'll want to use it all the time.",Positive
"I know, I know, many people hate on this pedal, calling it &#34;stale&#34;, and &#34;generic&#34;. The problem that they have is that they simply haven't found the right settings on the pedal and the amp, because, after all, the settings on both the amp, and the pedal do make a difference. One thing to note is that it is a bit on the quiet side in my opinion. I have a Digitech Bad Monkey, and I set the level on that to 2 so it matches up with the amp. With this pedal, I have to crank the level to make the clean tone the same level as the distorted tone.",Positive
"This is an excellent distortion pedal for people who want a traditional rock sound. I use it with a Fender Mustang amp and an Ibanez guitar with good humbucking pickups. It's very easy to use and rugged. If you play metal, you might want to get the HardWire TL-2 instead; that pedal delivers more distortion (an insane amount, if necessary) and more tone control, but it's also more expensive. But you can easily boost the distortion achieved by the DS-1 by using it with your amp on an overdriven setting. The DS-1 is an excellent general purpose distortion pedal. I don't know of any other that achieves this level of quality in the same price-range.",Positive
"First off I am no expert on these things but I can tell you in the brief period in which I have owned my DS-1 I have enjoyed playing/practicing a lot more with this pedal.  I have a Fender wannabe guitar, and a Fender Sidekick 10 which means my gear isn't the best but the pedal produces a wide variety of distortion and tone changes which keeps me interested.  I am having so much fun that I don't even notice my fingers hurt anymore.  Honestly, this is an essential buy when starting out along with headphones and a cord extension so the police don't come a knockin.(update Sept 2012)It is a year later and I have a much better guitar and amp and a lot more knowledge.  I am glad I got the DS-1 but for other reasons.  Sure it made me enjoy playing and practicing a lot more but I soon found the sound was off considering I like more blue and classic rock.  Again for the money I dont think you can beat it but more importantly when you have a few buck you can send it out for modification from Keeley.  Initially I had wished I went with and overdrive (OCD or Boss OD-3) but with the mod done by Keeley I have a super flexible pedal that cover just about all the sounds I need.  In closing, spend the $40 buck and get this....and then when you start wishing it could do more send it off to be modified and you will thank yourself later.",Positive
Good metal distortion tone with bags of sustain but sucks a lot of tone (most metal pedals do) and is moderately noisy. If you are looking for classic rock sounds you won't find them here. Can get muddy at times but there are plenty of settings to tweak to get the sound you are looking for. I find it useful for high gain leads and palm mute rhythms but note definition is not so good with chords. For the price this pedal is a good deal though!,Positive
"I've had this for about 11 years now. Even with some of the newer metal pedals on the market, this pedal still sells well. Not to mention, it's probably also one of the most modded pieces out there. Any number of mods can be found online to change the sound. They're usually on the side of improving the stock tone, which I'm happy with.I've always liked the parametric EQ on this pedal. The variable midrange allows me to get Marshall or Mesa flavors. For most metal/hard rock music, the gain range is enough for me. If I need yet more gain, I punch it up with an overdrive, or a compressor pedal for a cleaner boost. Even without a boost, I can use it for death metal. I think if you play the tighter, more technical styles, it's better not to have too much gain anyhow.",Positive
"To be honest, I was looking for a pedal that would give me distortion similar to Megadeth's first album KIMB. So far I havnt got a perfect setup on it yet, but ive got close enough to it. This pedal is great, only a couple notes I should make about it. Do NOT buy this pedal if your expecting to play classic rock, or just rock in general. This pedal is for metal. The battery drains like a MF. I dont understand why. The only possible explanation I can think is that I leave it plugged into guitar and amp, but ive had other pedals that wouldnt drain the battery unless its TURNED ON. I prefer just to get an AC adapter and not use batteries. Other than those few things iv had no problems with this great pedal.",Positive
"I have a lot of pedals...  In fact, I have 2 distortion and 2 overdrive pedals (though only the MT2 and the OD3 are regularly in my rig.)  This pedal won't give you a ""cranked up tube stack"" sound.  No...  Instead, it's very edgy and smooth as can be.  It has a mid-sweep knob on it to help sculpt your tone.  I usually use it as a mid-boost for solos.  You'll find that you get amazing sustain and a huge sound that you won't be able to replicate (easily... I'm sure the huge Boss distortion box comes close, but for the price...) with any other pedal.",Positive
"I bought mine used three years ago and it works great. It works for a Metallica, Pantera type sound. You can also get good rock sounds with the gain turned down and eq. adjusted.",Positive
"Its a great pedal, sound really crunchy, I got a peavy vyper sometime I use this If I want a crunchy style, but the amp I got is really good and has its own distortion styles, I use the heavy metal config on this pedal, I recomend it to anyone... does not introduce noise, I run it on the stock battery, it still works, you can make your guitar sound like Metallica or Megadeth, of course it also depends on a lot of things, like pickups, amp, etc..., I also have a very old little peavey practice amp, this blows away the distortion that it has with less noise and gives it a new life.Listen to it on the Boss website, I heard to it and then I thought the sound was not going to be similar because of the equipment used by them, but it does sound really really close. regards. forgive my english... not from the U.S",Positive
"BY FAR the best distortion pedal out there. No doubt about that. Several of my friends use this pedal, and they all love it. I also see many popular bands using this distortion pedal. It's great for medal. It have a nice punch to it along with a great &#34;cut&#34; so you're palm mutes don't blend into each other like other pedals. There are several knobs offering seemingly unlimited combinations. AMAZING",Positive
"First of all I want to say I love a tube amp distortion.  Overdriven tubes are just how its meant to be.  I run a Randall G3 hybrid amp and it destroys any solid state I've used or heard.  For recording I use a Peavey 5150 and its so sweet.  Tubes are how guitar was meant to be heard.Recently I started playing with a band that required a dirty tone that I felt like could only be achieved through a pedal.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with using distortion pedals, I used the DOD death metal for years when I first started playing.  However, there is a downside.  Go cheap and you get a piece of crap that makes your rig sound like an old AM radio, if you want something that sounds pro quality your going to shell out at least $250.  Quality dist. pedals are not budget friendly.I chose the MT-2 because I know Boss makes a quality product and it was the pedal the other guitarist was using.  It gives a variety of sounds.  It can be set up for an overdriven light distortion sound or full blown high gain metal tones.  The controls make it very tweakable and I have gotten a load of very nice sounds out of it.  Read the included book, look up some MP3s over videos online and check out other guitarists' settings.  It will help you tame this pedal into what you want.  Perfect pedal for those not wanting to spend a whole lot.  There are also mods you can buy and install in the pedal or buy preinstalled from certain dealers that open it up to even more shaping and make it more useful.I've seen a lot of complaints about the pedal sounding like nothing but fuzz.  I must say learn how to shape sound, spend time dialing it in to your rig.  Within 10 minutes I was pleased with the MT-2.  I used it on my overdrive channel to push it harder and got a really thick, heavy distortion with a good response.I say the MT-2 is worth an investment if you're looking for a big distortion sound from a little pedal.  Surely something guitarists should consider adding to their board.",Positive
"This is a great pedal I picked up used, they can be had cheaply on the used market. I actually use it with both an acoustic electric guitar to get a little distortion and the bass guitar for some grit. The 2 EQ pots on the front panel make it very versatile, enough to use with a cigar box guitar also.The pedal can preserve bass signal and still be EQ'd for saturated distortion. The other reviews speak for this pedal both here and on other sites and one can see why it is so popular. I also other Boss Distortion pedals. Like most people, I own a DS-1 and an MD-2 which are both cheap and effective. I own a HM-2 Heavy Metal 2 which caters more to the traditional metal sound and I actually think this pedal is more versatile IMO with different guitars where you may not want a strictly metal tone.I also own an older 80's HM-2 Heavy Metal which will run circles around the metal zone for classic thrash and speed metal tones and almost any other heavy distortion pedal that I could never part with, overall i like this pedal, but it cannot top the older legendary Boss pedals.",Positive
Bought it as a gift. Friend loved it very much.,Positive
"I love BOSS pedals. I owned a DS-1 (Distortion) and a MT-2 (Metal Zone) for years, and loved them both. This one, is a good ""meet in the middle"" of those two. It's great if you want some really good bluesy distortion, or you can crank the color and get some thick distortion.As always, this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy. I love it.",Positive
"This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there.",Positive
"very simple, very user-friendly,and the feature that is most important i think, versatile. the OS/DS and drive knobs allow you to chose between a very different bunch of tones. and also, for the money, a great deal. 100% recommended.",Positive
"I first used this pedal when my green screemer died. A friend had and os-2 on hand and let me use it. I had used Boss's metal zone before and it produced too nasal of a tone for my liking. So I plug into the OS-2 and I was pleasently impressed with the range of distortion and overdrive the OS-2 pedal produced. I play through a '59 fender bassman and the mix of those tubes with this pedal produce some very sweet tones. I have also played this pedal through a solid state amp and I am still impressed. I have spent years searching for a pedal that could produce a nice tight churnch with a warm and low bottom end, my search ended with this pedal. I highly recomend this pedal to any rock, blues, metal, country, or punk guitar player.",Positive
"This thing freaking rocks! I LOVE this pedal. I can't stop using it. Sometimes I just play long, drawn out chords so I can listen to this amazing tone [in combo with distortion on my amp - it's perfect metal!!]",Positive
"If you want your guitar to sound like Eddie Van Halen, Joe Satriani and other guitarists studio album guitar sound, then get a BOSS GT-10 (guitar multi effects processor) and install BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg. Search Google for BOSS GT-10 Patches by James Limborg.",Negative
These came stock on my Jackson Kelly KEXMG. All the other guitars I own have Schaller buttons on them and I have one main strap I use for all of the guitars. I figured since the guitar came with them I would try them out. Not twenty min later I was removing them and putting Schaller buttons in their place. Here the 3 major reasons I did not like them over Schaller:1- Bulky. They stick out too far and on any guitar with a strap button on the back it jabs you in the stomach or below!2- Problems engaging. I would push them into the receiver and they pop back out. It wasn't until I forced them in while pushing the button that they went in a stayed in. Schallers click in and you know they are ready to go.3- Cheap. They just feel cheap. Thin metal is used in comparison to the Schallers; which have a very heavy and solid feel to them.For a few bucks more I'll stick with Schaller's. I have been using them for 10+ years and have never seen one fail.,Negative
"I was very disappointed in both the quality and engineering of this product. A work-around for the main issue follows the review. The flaws that bother me in order of significance are:1) Quality: Very weak soft-metal screws. Using minimal force and a well aligned driver there was some damage to the screw-heads on all 4 that I worked with. 2 of them rounded out so much that I was afraid they would be hard to remove later, causing me to run to the hardware store for higher quality replacement screws.2) Engineering : The instructions recommend, and the screws (the ones that come with the straplocks) are designed for a #2 Phillips screwdriver. However, a standard #2 driver is too big to fit into the strap-buttons. So you are likely to have to choose between grinding down a screwdriver to fit, or using a #1 which will increase the impact of the first problem above since it is the wrong tool for the job.3) Engineering : The point of connection for the strap is 5/8th of an inch out from the guitar. The strap button has a radius about 3/16ths of an inch. Therefore any lateral stress (i.e. weight of the guitar) is magnified by more than 3x due to leverage pulling outward on the screw. A 9 pound guitar would be applying a constant 27 to 30 pounds of force on the screw and the wood around it (half that when the weight is distributed evenly on two strap buttons of course). Get a little too active on stage and the level of force could go way higher.Realistically, if the screws weren't total crap, this might have been a 3 or 4 star review. Once you deal with the fact that a normal screwdriver won't fit and get the things properly installed, it would probably work out for most people. So if you are stuck with a set, here's what I recommend:Go to a hardware store and buy #6 x 1"" oval-head stainless steel replacement screws. Note that these won't fit properly, but they are the closest match and can be modified. (They are 21 cents each at my local stores, and would have cost Dunlop maybe 10 cents more in bulk than what they paid for the crap screws that come with this.)Put the screw into an electric drill (pointy end in) so the screw head is rotating smoothly when you operate the drill. Run the drill while using a file or a belt sander to take a fraction of the diameter off the screw head. It doesn't need much. I used a belt sander and it took about 20 seconds each. While you are at it, file down a cheap #2 screwdriver so it will fit into the strap button.Install with the new screws as normal, and recommend that your friends try a different brand!",Negative
"Sorry, I don't like these as they're just too big. They stand out too much. They do work and they're effective but they are too pronounced. There are many good alternatives; strap gaskets, strap locks, undoing the pin and putting it straight into the guitar strap.  Again, they work, but they're not aesthetic nor elegant. I also got a gold set for my bass and now it looks like I should be wearing big purple platforms when I play. Not cool.",Negative
"the thing is that they don't seem to stay! i mean, you can change the position of the pop filter by varying the shape of the metallic &#34;arm&#34;, but it doesn't stay where you put it. and also the material of the filter is of kinda poor quality. but, i think if you're lucky if just might get the job done.",Negative
I purchased this after reading the great reviews but like a few of the comments that are on here lately this thing is not good. Looked almost used when it arrived and the gooseneck stand is useless. Does not come even close to being able to hold up the weight of the filter. I would have returned it but I completely destroyed the package getting it open (which oddly had staples holding it closed).,Negative
"wind screen is way too big its bulky and to me useless, the screen came out, was thinking of glueing it back in but went to ebay and bought 2 metal mesh pop filters cheaper that is MUCH better...avoid this!!",Negative
"I ordered this product to use for personal recording, and thought...what could possibly go wrong? I ordered it ""New,"" and it definitely shows signs that it not new. First, the package was stapled, that's right- STAPLED together in a way in which you could tell the product had been opened. Then, to make matters worse, there is a hole in one side of the fabric. When I order something new, I expect it to be new. Based on this product alone, I would not recommend buying from this seller.",Negative
"Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.",Negative
"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price.",Negative
"I got this for my Boss Loop Station, but it doesn't work very well.  I keep hoping I'll find something it DOES work well with...",Negative
I bought the wrong gauge. I read a review that said that you should get a size less then you really want but they are wrong. I bought the .90 gauge at Guitar Center and love them. These were made for that Dave Mustain muted crunch sound. I don't know if I will use these forever but for right now I love them. Just hard enough for speed picking but light enough to stay in your hand without moving around like 1 mils do.Dunlop Ultex sound awesome and so far they still look like new.Buy em!!!!,Negative
"Long story short, this string set has a strong metallic character, which distorts the natural sound of your guitar so much. Many people might like it, but for me, absolutely Noooooooo!I have a seagull guitar, so by its nature it sounds mellow, warm and mild with stock strings. So when my strings wear out, I got this. Now I feel like playing an EMG bridge on my fender/archtop's neck position, WITHOUT the power that an EMG pickup has to offer. Yes, it is that bad, you can't do this to guitars like Seagulls...Bottom line, I recommend this string set for people looking to boost distortion on their guitar. If you have guitars like seagulls or so, definitely avoid this string.",Negative
"I've been playing guitar for over 40 years, and these Tortex picks are nearly the worst I'v ever used.  They are so noisy that they overpower the guitar strings with their clackity-clack noise.  Dunlop Ultex picks sound much better.",Negative
I can't hear the sounds of the strings over the flick of these flimsy picks across them. better for electric guitar but still hard to play fast,Negative
another item never received but i would not use anything over .88 mm anyway was mean for experimentation i have learned since this purchase.,Negative
"I recently bought a few packs of Jazz IIIs and I was shocked.  They don't play at all like what I was expecting.  Under high magnification the edge doesn't look the same as the old Jazz III either, and they don't play the same if you turn them over!!!  What's up with that?I'm sorry to give such a poor review to a great brand like Dunlop.  Let's hope this is just a short-term fluke.",Negative

"This product is not what it seems. It has a cool name, but that's about it. It's a tool oil that stinks. I tried my best to get use to this product, but learned that there are much better ways after going into the studio and recording for the 1st time. After doing away with the Fast-Fret, my playing has improved and I hardly ever have to change my string because of gook. Not to mention that getting that crap on my fingers was just nasty. I now use Old English and my guitars thank me, my nose thanks me and my fingers thank me. You will too...",Negative

"Years ago I used the Clayton &#34;small teardrop&#34; picks. I couldn't tell from the picture, that these were full size, and I didn't check the size in the description.  I still had a few of the small ones, so I used them as templates, to cut these down. I would have rated them higher, if I could have used them as is. It's my own fault for not looking at the specifications. I purchased two six packs of Clayton Teardrop picks, but found Dunlop 423R60 0.60mm (Orange) Tortex Small Tear Drop Guitar Picks, 36-Pack which are a lot cheaper.",Negative
"This is a basic EQ pedal, that is a bit noisy in my testing. Even when running on battery power, there is a bit of hiss that is just enough to be annoying in my rig and probably enought to be very annoying in some higher gain rigs.",Negative

It is not the size for mini guitar. May be for the big one...Connections are shaky. You will surely notice that the quality is toooo low.,Negative
"Total flimsy junk. It leans WAYYY too far back. I'll be damned if I put my $1000 guitars on these things. On the other hand, ChromaCast makes one that's very close to this price, and I doubt that it could have been more for the money I paid.In summary... DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK.",Negative
"...for something, but not a guitar.  Wasn't sure what to do with it so I now use it to mount a large cookbook, or notepad computer, so I can follow a recipe.  It seems to work okay for that.  Just don't use this for guitars.  An electric guitar will slide out and fall because it leans back too far, and the arms have no grip.  This thing was obviously created by a monkey in some closed door creative testing experimental project.  It may even give you AIDS!  But probably not.  However, animals could have been harmed in the making.  But most likely, and in reality, it will not hold your guitar in a safe manner.",Negative
"Not much better than the dollar version of the peg winder.  Thought it would be more ergonomic and having the stringer cutter in one tool would be a plus.... but, not quiet up to par.  You'll be better off with the dollar string winder and a cheap pair of snips.",Negative
"The wire clipper and winder work O.K., but the pin puller is badly designed and doesn't slip under the ball of the pin in order to lift it out. Bad design by someone who doesn't use it to pull pins out of a bridge. I end up using a Jim Dunlop capo to pull bridge pins out. I've done it successfully for years.",Negative
"Header says it all. Works well enough as a string winder, but I was really lookin for something to pull my bridge pins with and for me, this did not work well at all. Went back to my trusty rubber tipped pliers and just had to be gentle.",Negative
"I honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. First, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. Just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it, I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, I'll try the notch bridge peg puller. But other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;.",Negative
"I purchased Elixir strings after hearing them repeatedly recommended at the music store.  Put them on my Eko Ranger XII acoustic 12 string.  Have 2 problems with the strings.  First, the bass E (11th string) broke while tuning it up.  Had to go to music store and buy a single replacement string (not Elixir).  I have changed strings many, many times, so I am convinced it was not my stringing, but a weakness in the E string itself.  Second, the high D (8th string) seems ""dead""; it does not ""ring"" as it should and as the other high strings do (though none as much as other 12 string sets I've used).  Considering these strings cost much more than others, I certainly am disappointed in them.  Hardly matters if they last longer if they don't sound as good.",Negative
I bought a set as they were recommended to get the tone I was looking for on my 7 week old guitar. Installed as usual and tuned them. They sounded good when played open but compressing them was nearly impossible. My capo could not even hold them. I set the guitar aside for a few minutes and heard the wood creaking. When I looked the face of the guitar was bowing up and the bridge was pulling up and back as if they were trying to pry it off. I released the tension on all the strings as fast as I could and left it. I returned them and got some lighter ones but to no avail. The body is cracked around the bridge and it is useless now. Use at your own risk!!!!!!! I personally wouldn't give a nickel for them.,Negative
not two weeks after I put these on the A string broke close to the ball on the string.  I break high e strings on occasion.  but something as thick as an A string?? maybe it was a defective string as I thankfully bought two sets and I was able to pull the A out of the other set and it has been fine since.  now however I have the dilemma of should I just buy more strings and just use the second set as I need them.  Further more do I stick with the same brand.  that is supposed to last longer than average strings.  At this point I am going to keep playing this set until its time to change then go from there.  I will update once I decide if I should stick with this brand or go back to super slinky'supdate 3/25well another month went by(a week ago) and the D string broke in the same fashion leaving me to believe I either got defective strings are these strings are not as good as they are said to be. either way its losing another star.  if it happens with a different set of strings I will reevaluate my guitar/review and change accordingly,Negative
"I bought these strings after buying some Elixir strings for my acoustic, which I was pretty happy with.  For my strat, however, these strings did not sound right from the start. After about a week I really started wondering if it was just in my head or if I really didn't have sustain that I thought I usually got from a new pair of strings.  I convinced myself that it was these strings that were causing all my problems, and I was right.  I put a pair of D'Addario XL 9.5 (highly recommended for those players who can't decide between 9s or 10s) and was amazed at how much tone and sustain I was losing with these Elixir strings.  I did feel like I could move up and down the fretboard easily with these strings, but the lack of sustain and tone have forced me to stay way from these electric strings permanently.  Don't let the higher price on these strings entice you, go with a good set of D'Addario or Ernie Ball strings for consistent long-lasting strings.",Negative
Looked like the chrome was cheesey and they ended up breaking but they worked while they were used in a guitar with the proper pinhole next to the screw position,Negative
"Did not hold the strings down very well for me... I love the feel of it, but the spring needs more power.",Negative
"This is an update to my original review because I have now fully tested two of these capos.  I'm truly surprised by all the good reviews here.  I'm not sure how it's possible.  I've already outlined below in my original review that these are not Jim Dunlop capos.  I had purchased two, which I have now given away to student players as I cannot use them.  I tested the capos on a standard acoustic and also an electric guitar.  The E string buzzes when the capo is applied and no amount of adjusting the capo would stop the buzz from occurring. Both capos had this very same problem.When I received these capos, I noticed right away that they were not the same excellent quality as actual Jim Dunlop capos.  The craftsmanship was visibly lower quality and the materials used are a lesser quality than official Jim Dunlop capos.  The rubber has a strong odor and there is no brand-name printed anywhere on the product.  As a professional musician, I need to purchase reputable brand-name products because I can't afford to have my gear failing during performances.  I have no idea about the future performance of these capos because they have no apparent brand, and no measurable reputation.  When I contacted the seller, they were not honest with me.",Negative
"I know many people love the design, but I find it much too frustrating. You have to be very careful putting it on the fret correctly, then snap it in, then turn and turn the screw, oops don't let it snap off again and fall off while trying to turn the screw. Then you have to go through the whole routine again to take it off and move it to another fret and put it on again. What a farce. This is the worst capo I've owned, and I've tried nearly every brand and type. Yeah, I've had people show me how to do it right, and I know to do it right. It's just wrong to have to spend so much time slipping it on, snapping it, screwing it in, screwing it off, having it fall off, forget it, it's garbage to me. Also, while I'm getting my callouses worked out playing for two hours every day, the last thing I want is to pinch my fingers against metal trying to turn a screw. It's actually slightly painful to the fingers (momentarily, but why have to deal with that??) to work with. This design seems like it was a non guitar player who came up with it. The only good thing I can say about it is looks durable.No thanks.",Negative
"I bought this hoping to use as intended, angled into guitar & straight into mixer, wrong, have to use it the other way around ... sad!",Negative

"I recently traveled across country carrying 2 similar guitars. One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in this Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but after having the padding fall out, I just ordered another SKB Fender case.  The Gator will be re-glued and used only for local trips.  The SKB Fenders will be my airline cases from now on.",Negative
"I don't know who designed the leg feature of this thing, but they need to go back to engineering school. When you unlock the legs to put them into their useable position, they're quite difficult to pop open, and once opened into place, you can see distinct spots where the paint has worn off, because the fit is too tight inside the upper body of the stand.It'd truly be nice to come across a good stand like this that used button locks to hold the legs in place, and that had more of an upright angle for the guitar. I just don't like the features of this stand at all.",Negative
"I've used three pop filters in my experiences with home recording and podcasting.  This one is the worst.  The plastic screw (yes, plastic) that is meant to grip the pole that you attach the pop filter to, is completely incapable of supporting it's own weight at nearly any angle.  Bad...just bad.Secondly, there is a metal piece that secures the flex arm to the clamp.  It seemed loose after I got it out of the packaging and the flex arm would wobble and rotate in that spot causing a major problem when it came to proper placement.  After twisting on it twice I stripped it out.  Now the thing is worthless.  I'm returning it ASAP.I would rather go to a lady's bag flea market sale with a crazy woman for a day than continue to put up with this thing.  Do yourself a huge favor and buy the Nady 6"" pop filter.  If you don't, you'll wish you did.",Negative
"Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says ""Heavy Duty"" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead.",Negative
Its poorly made with attention to detail. I ordered them to fit on my dual mic clamp purchased here at Amazon. But they will not screw down all the way and are losse. It is useless!!! Other mic holders from different manufacturers work fine.,Negative

not so pleased with the sound quality..sorta disappointed with it over all...but ya get what ya pay for ....so i'll keep it anyway,Negative
CRAP these strings are bad do not buy them if you play any kind of harder music or do a lot of string bends unless you like having strings almost take out your eyes then by all means buy em errrrr i always buy Ernie balls but i got cheap and tryed to save a few buck and buy 2 3 packs of these hunks of crap for under 18 bucks i should have spent the extra 7 bucks and got the 6 pack of Ernies I didn't even get a week out of them and they were rusted and poppin off left and right....................never again,Negative
"I've purchased these locally several times over the past three years at a music store. Mainly due to the low cost. They work okay, but are difficult to keep in tune. The guitars have to be re-tuned often when temperature, humidity, or playing more than ten minutes occurs. My biggest complaint is tarnish and corrosion. Add that to the winding separating over the fret bars exposing the inner solid string, then the strings go ""flat"" sounding. These are not quality strings at all, just cheap Chinese Made quality. They are okay for someone that doesn't play often, but if you play daily or as a performer, avoid these strings. Better strings are worth the extra cost. You actually save money by not having to replace them often as you do with these cheap strings. I've had this problem with all the D'Addario brand strings, both for electric or acoustic, 6 or 12 string guitars. The thinner gauge strings will break during tuning or playing. The tarnish and corrosion often ends up contaminating the fret bars and keeping the neck dirty all the time. Cleaning after each playing session only makes the strings corrode faster.",Negative
"I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.",Negative

"This was bought based on the advice of others. I had a cable with the standard Neutrik/Switchcraft-type ends fail on me, and this cable was supposed to be either strain free or simply designed for long life because of the strain of usage.It worked great for about 4-6 months, and then broke. It happened so quickly (the trad types seem to take longer) that I swore it must have been the output jack on my guitar. After confirming the guitar was okay, I tried a shorter cable, which worked fine.D'Addario does offer lifetime replacement, but it puts you in a bit of a bind - you need a backup cable while you are waiting for a replacement, and you have to pay return shipping of the defective cable out-of-pocket. You also have to get R.A. Taken altogether, this makes it a deal breaker. The extra costs essentially make this cable as expensive as something that has a track record of lasting for years. In my case, I bit the bullet and did what I should have done the first go-round and got a really nice DiMarzio cable.Again, this cable SOUNDS good while it works - capacitance with the longer cables can be an issue. The good news is that IMO high price is not a guarantee of ANY cable sounding good. The replacement DiMarzio is another example of one that was at the top of the list with cable comparisons. I don't get into the mojo or intangible aspects that will typically find someone paying much more for a cable, but I want durability and published capacitance that is within a certain range. This one meets half of those criteria, but it gets expensive because of the potential to fail sooner rather than later. Well, expensive relative to a cable with an initially higher price but longer lifespan.So the replacement that Planet Waves sent me is now the backup, and is still in the original packaging. I figure I'll use it only for short periods while replacing my main cable, so it should last a long time in that situation. If I have a few $ for the shipping and D'Addario is still honoring the lifetime warranty if/when the 2nd one breaks, I may get it replaced. More likely I will just chalk it up to a learning lesson and toss it. Even $4 shipping is a decent percentage of the cost of a more durable cable - IMO it should be set aside to fund its eventual replacement.If this cable would have last 1.5 to 2 years, I'd probably give it 5 stars given the price. And if D'Addario took away the warranty thing, it would probably re-shape the customer's perception on what something at this price should cost, because it's a wear item, plain and simple. IDK how much R&D; it's worth their trouble to put in something at this price point, but that's is what I would shoot for - a realistically acceptable period of trouble-free use w/no warranty as the trade-off. That would NOT make it a deal breaker.",Negative
Well this cable certainly didn't last long as the title says 8 weeks.  Bought a new Fender Mustang2 v2 amp a week and a half ago.  Last night amp would turn on but wasn't putting out any sound from the guitar. Messed around a bit and it started to work.  Today same thing and it's obvious nothing is going from guitar to amp.  Thought I had a bad jack in my new amp and wasn't very happy.  Got out the old amp and guess what nothing there either.  At least my new amp is working and I only have to replace a $12 cord.Maybe I'm just unlucky and got a bad one and if I bought it at a local store I'd return it.  Not going through the hassles of mailing it back or asking for a refund.  Will just move on to another company's cord.,Negative
The cable died on me in less than a month. Very disappointed in built quality.,Negative
These look so neat that my brother and I both unknowingly ordered these for each other as gifts last Christmas. Unfortunately they feel too chunky to use and the colored tip grips the strings in an unfortunate way making it difficult to play.,Negative
I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-),Negative

"This arrived and when I tried to use it, it turned out that the male threads were some  oddball metric size that does NOT fit any standard adapter.Instead, these theads stripped the fitting on my mike clip, so now I have to go somewhere else and buy a new gooseneck AND a clip.This is such a standard item, that there is no excuse for making it with non-standard threads, and NO excuse at all for advertising it as standard 5/8ths...",Negative
"I have several MXR pedals. Every one is superb--except for this PHASE 90 (the non-""script"" version reviewed here). This PHASE 90 is worthless for anyone who wants to use it while playing clean, for it adds a tsunami of irritating distortion, a swoosh of sonic dirt. I did some research and discovered that other people who also hate this pedal's distortion suggest some modifications. (Look up ""MXR Phase 90 Mods,"" and ""Erik's Corner"" will show you how.) I made the ""R28,"" ""C11,"" and ""C12"" modifications. The result: a slightly improved phaser, one that still churned out plenty of distortion. Finally, I tried adjusting the internal trim pot. On no setting could I get rid of ... you guessed it: distortion. I spent literally hours in a futile and frustrating effort to make this pedal sound merely acceptable. No luck. BOTTOM LINE: IF YOU WANT A PHASER THAT DOESN'T ADD SIGNIFICANT DISTORTION, AVOID THIS INCARNATION OF THE PHASE 90.",Negative

This pedal is very well constructed but it goes through batteries like CRAZY!

"If you plan to use this pedal as a traditional volume pedal in a Guitar > Volume Pedal > Amp configuration (inserting effects pedals anywhere you like), this is a POORLY engineered pedal.  It can't be ""true bypass"" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years.If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT ""true bypass"" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple ""first do no harm"" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their ""string"" mechanism over time.  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver.",Negative

Even though my cheap cord was still working fine, I really wanted to just try out the new cord.I really wish I had done that in the first 30 days. This cord did not work right at all.

"D'Addario,what's up? These didn't last long at all.I don't play my Martin very often,(too busy with electrics..) but these were trashed in a month.Guess your using recycled car bumpers for strings now? Never purchase again.",Negative
This is a beautiful shock mount. However for the price it didnt perform. The mount doesnt fit directly to the blue yeti and it leaks wind and plosive sounds on P's and S's. Not worth the price.,Negative
"I was not happy with the sound of these strings. The EAD steel wound strings sound dull and the nylon GBE strings sound tinny. For an extra $2 I bought the D'Addario EJ45 Pro Arte and got a much, much higher quality sound out of my 40 yr old Yamaha G-60.  Spend the extra $2 its well worth it.",Negative
"I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them.  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball.",Negative
"If you expect to get what you pay for, prepare to be disappointed. Sounds weak. Sounds old. Sounds worn. Sounds dull. I wanted to experience a new brand on my Stratocaster. I can afford to pay twice as much. But I am going to keep using my D'adario Strings from now on. I am so disappointed. These strings are for the &#34;campfire guitarist&#34; not the aggressive picking thrilling, tapping, pull offs, or sweepers. If you are a tone fanatic keep looking. If your guitar deserves the best, do not betray your instrument or insult your tube amp with these strings. Respect your GUITAR.  I wouldn't be surprised if they are made from China.",Negative
"I thought something was drastically wrong with my guitar but it was these strings, they buzzed and move so much they hit every metal on every fret.",Negative
"I bought one of these in the beginning - just to have something - as this is better than having nothing at all - but it's certainly nothing special. The material and the skinny width was uncomfortable for me and exacerbated my neck pain, so I only used it for a very short time.On the other hand, if you have a nice guitar that you really take great care of, then you'll probably want to invest in a much nicer strap at some point. I upgraded to a really nice 3&#34; wide black leather Levy's guitar strap - which is five stars all the way.If you're a newbie and don't have a strap, and are on a tight budget and need something, then this Planet waves strap will probably work for you - till you can upgrade to something nicer and more comfortable to wear. Just my 2 cents.",Negative
I have a Taylor 710ce and this strap had to be forced over the top connection near the neck of the guitar. Rather than ruin the finish of the guitar I just got a different strap. Plus the nylon slips very easy which is not a plus for me since I had to keep correcting the position of the guitar to where I liked it to play. If the nylon is not a problem for you and the ends fit over your guitar this strap is very well made.,Negative
"Based upon some of the other reviews, I feel I got a different product, as it didn't fit the descriptions given by others. I ordered two of these, and both were very thin material, not sturdy at all. Second, both straps were not adjustable to 59&#34;. Both mine measured 45&#34; from strap button hole to strap button hole, fully-extended. They are useless to me, as my guitar, a dreadnought, covers the middle of my chest when I put it on. I believe I was given a substitute product, since when I ordered these straps, the price was just $1.00, and now they're back up to $4.95 as I write this. I'm really sick of these Amazon substitutions. For what I paid, I won't bother returning them...not worth the hassle. I will donate them to a local music teacher who has students with smaller guitars. Very disappointed. Warning...if you see a price drop below $4.95, don't buy...it's probably not the product that's described here.",Negative
"Good for a cheap beginner strap used for sitdown practice.This was my first guitar strap i had ever bought. I didnt really care about quality i just needed a strap to get by. Over the 6 months ive had it i took it off my electric guitar and put it on a new electric acoustic I recently got and it keeps popping off. This is a problem is standing up playing at a gig or just around your house. The guitar could take that head dive of death, while one dive might not do too much damage a few might crack the neck or worse.My Advice: unless you plan to sit and play (which you wont really need a strap anyways) the whole time, spend alittle more to get a leather strap. Spending more on a leather strap will help avoid hole stretching and the popping off of the strap in mid play.",Negative
"I really wanted this to work, but it doesn't.  Don't bother,it doesn't mute the strings at all.  One star, just for it getting here on time.",Negative
"I bought a Glaesel Bridge & this Glaesel rubber mute together. I bought this because it was cheap and had so many good reviews. The mute fits the bridge fine, but compared to a brass mute (which of course works VERY well) this mute seems to do absolutely nothing. There is almost no discernible difference in playing the violin with or without this mute on. Also, the mute can affect your playing so certain notes screech or stutter or produce other undesirable noises.If You want or need a mute for practicing quietly (as many of us do), I suggest you buy something else. This item does not work and is a total waste of money. I tried this mute on a regular acoustic violin as well as a new Electric Violin bought here on Amazon (FYI, that cheap little electric violin is an awesome & fun item! *Just make sure you buyThe Original Peg Drops by Ardsley& aGlaesel Self-Adjusting 4/4 Violin Bridge Mediumwith it!).I consider this mute completely useless since it does not do anything at all. It does *not* mute or lower the volume of any violin in any noticeable way.",Negative
"Pedal is not working, it just making noise. Poor quality control.Actually it looks like used pedal, not like new.Don't recommend this product.",Negative
"All I gotta say about  this product is that I get a volume/tone loss when it's plugged; that is a very big problem for me. Other than that is very well built, but the fact that it decreases my volume is a major issue for me.",Negative
"The travel would be tolerable for a sitting position..., but I stand in front of a mic on stage.  The pedal generates  a lot of &#34;noise&#34; so I can't use it.  You get what you pay for.  King Vox and Dunlop High Gain, both passive, have passed the test, and I'm pretty picky!",Negative
"I purchased this as an extra CV controller for a Digitech Control 2. When I got it, I tried it out as a volume pedal just for kicks and YES it does suck the tone right out of the signal. As far as a CV controler? it sucks at that too! Why? it squeaks as you move it (after 5 minutes use, right out of the box). Behringer is a joke and gives German engineering a bad name (although only 'conceived' in Germany).It's a direct copy of the Yamaha FC9 and so I am about to purchase one of those and see how it compares. I'm betting the extra 45 dollars will be well worth it.Also, you may say ""who cares if it squeaks a little""? well I do when I am controlling volume swells or a 'wah' effect at low volume in the studio!Good luck if you buy it.",Negative
"I ordered two of them and both arrived within a week. I tested both of them, they sound quite good as the majority reviewers said (that's why I bought this !!!). And they are solidly built too, not one of the pretty light microphone that comes in with cheap karaoke machine.I don't expect to come with it, so no cable is OK for me.Here is the BUT ...... : there is no ON/OFF switch, this really pissed me off.But this is my fault, I should have read the 1 star review first.The photo shows no ON/OFF switch, however this does not catch any attention.And all seller seems to have trouble to say ""this product does not have this, does not have that..."" It only says what the product does have.Oh well, I got stuck with two microphones without ON/OFF switch.I can buy an adapter with on/off switch for microphone.",Negative
"Pretty disappointed in the color. As the review title indicates, what I received is more of a 'black chrome' or dingy stainless color. These are simply not going to work with the MOTS pickguard I purchased them for. Perhaps they would blend in better on a black, black pearl or tort pickguard.I ordered another package from another vendor and got the same result. Perhaps it is a large factory shipment that is 'bad'. Some are very dull looking. Very disappointing, really.",Negative
I can't believe these were actually sent to me. The heads are smaller than normal pickguard screws and the metal is blackened. They come from Taiwan but look like they were subcontracted to China. I am sending them back. There is no way I would use these. Any screw you get from Home Depot would work better and look more attractive. I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.,Negative
"I was a little disappointed.  Don't know if it's a QC problem or if I just got some rejects but out of 6 pots, 1 was out of spec (315k) and 2 were almost out (289k, 205k).  1 was right on the money and the other 2 were within 10%.  They are CTL's so I'm a bit confused.  Other than that they work fine, they have the nut, washer and cap included (no knob).  I will be upgrading the caps.",Negative
This pickguard was used. It not only was missing the protective plastic but it actually was scratched from being on a guitar before.,Negative
"I would think it would be reasonable to assume that this would fit a Squier Bullet Strat, but the holes didn't line up, it didn't fit between the neck and the bridge, in fact, it was completely wrong. Nice quality though.",Negative
Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. Doesn't fit perfect. Kinda bummed but oh well,Negative
"Buttons itself are fine, however when I was installing it the screw broke inside the guitar (right above the thread). And I even pre-drill it. there is no way I can get it out :( so had to find real screw and drill new hole next to it (now slightly off-center now)",Negative
"Need 2 volume knobs and 1 tone, so for the price (and in the past) I have always purchased 2 packs together with no issues, however recently I needed and ordered some and I found out of 4 sets, no consistency in quality... example the lettering is thinner on some than others within the same set and between sets of the same item#. Also some had bright white lettering and others did not (but where not vintage lettering either). Guess these are too cheap for Fender to have QC on.Will try other brands next time.",Negative
"I've ordered two of these kits in the aged white, and each one has had severe scratches and scuffs all over the tremolo cavity cover plate. Literally to the point where it looks like someone dropped them on a concrete floor, accidentally stepped on them, and then decided they were good enough to send out for sale. The knobs, covers and tips are all in great shape, however.",Negative
"Unless you guys are receiving something I am not, how can you give this anything more than one star. My backplate is so thin and cut so close to the screws that you can actually see were the route begins on the back of my Fender stratocaster. This is inexcusable. All the other Fender backplates I have have enough lip to cover the route, but not this mint green one. I simply cannot understand what Fender is thinking.  I am seeing nothing but product after product like this coming from Fender and it is a clear sign they are simply trying to maximize profits at any cost.",Negative
"My first desk mic stand, and the adjuster part broke after only two days of use. It worked once when I originally set it, then kaput. It's never worked properly since. I still use it but have to wrap electrical tape so that it's at the right height. I would not purchase this product again.",Negative
"these strings are great if you need practice changing your strings. these strings last 2 days and then they are dull and lifeless and need to be changed, the high e and the b string tend to break before they even get tuned to pitch, Ernie Ball strings are garbage, the only time I will buy these is if it's the only thing available, most people like these because they are endorsed by so many musicians that are paid to say that they like this garbage, and even if they do like them they are not your average players that need more than 2 days out of a set of strings, Touring musicians have the guitar tech change the strings after they play their set, and they get an unlimited amount of these crap strings so their guitars always sound fresh,  you can spend 4$ for a set of Ernie Ball or D'Addario every 2 days or you can spend $7 for a set of DR strings and change them once a month, or you can spend 10$ for a set of Elixir Polywebs and change your strings once every 3 months,  It doesn't make sense to use these crappy Ernie's unless you are sponsored by EB and have an endless supply and a tech to change them for you like the rockstars,",Negative
"It is OK, but it does not compare to the ergo holder.Which you may find here:Dunlop Ergo Pickholder.The main problem with this pickholder is that it is very difficult to get your pick out, and it is extremely fragile.",Negative
"I bought one of each Soft, Medium and Hard Wedgie rubber picks and even though the colours were right, the Hard is as soft as the Soft. They felt exactly the same in fact. The Medium was the hardest out of the bunch.Packaging error? I have no idea. The fact that each stiffness only comes in one colour and the colours were right lead me to think something is wrong with the manufacturing. So check with what you get.Sound wise, the rubber really removes the treble on my acoustic guitar, making it sound really dull and muted.There is a lot more friction from the rubber on the strings that I do not think it is idea for strumming.The only reason I can think of using is if you want to reduce the noise but frankly, you would have much more control if you used your fingers instead.",Negative
"I purchased these picks, because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band. We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise. I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise. They don't make that annoying plastic to metal sound, but they are very flexible. I need to have alot of pick speed. These slow me down way to much. The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to.",Negative
"I should have read the reviews carefully - it's definitely something different, but not sturdy at all, rubber bits come off as you strum, and there are complaints of skid marks on strings and fingers. Ouch! I'm much happier with my Friday the 13th glow-in-the-dark picks - that is an experiment that worked!And who cares about hard pick sounds anyway? If you want something that sounds like your fingers strumming, why don't you use&#8230; your fingers?",Negative
"These picks do cut pick noise but with an acoustic guitar they wear very rapidly and leave a rubbery residue all over my guitar. I don't like the thought of what damage that stuff would do over time to the inside of my guitar with that stuff getting all over my pickups, etc. Big disappointment. I'm getting a lot of high string in my guitar sound and thought these picks might solve the problem. Back to the drawing board I go.",Negative
I tried it for iPad. It kinda wobbles up and down. It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad.  I only recommend it for something light weight.  There's better ones out there. See my review on the music stand. That comes with a solid extension arm...,Negative
"OK, it was cheap (nine bucks at the time), the design looked good and sensible, and it seemed a perfect solution to a real need. I bought it without hesitation. HOWEVER(!), once hooked up, I was very surprised how flimsy it is. I have a 13"" gooseneck, a light condenser mic and small shock-mount on it. At the slightest movement of the mic stand this attachment flaps up and down like crazy and will continue this way for a something like a minute if not stopped by hand. Obviously, any small bump into the stand will once again set this off. Using it at home, I've gotten away with not touching the stand while recording by being very careful, but obviously this unit is far from ideal. Since then, I've gotten another sidemount boom from this same brand, and though I haven't really put through its paces yet, this other unit is rock solid and far more adjustable and reliable, AND only costs a few bucks more (On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom). For anyone considering this product, I HIGHLY recommend bypassing this one and forking out just a few more bucks for the On Stage MSA9508 Posi-Lok Sidemount Boom. You will be far far happier.Cheers!",Negative
"I thought I could take the smell. I couldn't.Otherwise it would be a decent deal and not bad sounding.The case is nice too, but everything smells like the Chinese rubber smell at Harbor Freight Tools. (sulfur?)I tried airing it out for a week with no success.If you have no sense of smell, get one.",Negative
"The material it's made of is good, and it holds the guitar. The only things i don't like are 2.1)Each of the corners has a cap. The one at the bottom where you actually put the guitar it comes off.2)The part at the bottom that looks like a U (used to hold the guitar) it spins... It means that there is nothing like a bolt or a screw to make it stay still, so every time you try to put your guitar on you have to make sure to put that straight.I would suggest to but a more expensive model or a totally different one.",Negative
"it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together I am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. The bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, I am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...I prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. This one? Meh. Not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo.",Negative
"I'm another reviewer who has, upon personal inspection, discovered that the rear leg of the stand is too short to provide staedy support for any beloved guitar. I returned it.I've &#34;First Act&#34; brand stands similar in appearance but more intelligently constructed.",Negative
"This arrived with one end of the security strap and metal part...Broken! OK...I bought it on sale and returning it would not be an option...it would cost as much to mail back as it did to buy it!Obviously it was not the packaging which was more than adequate and there were no broken off pieces in the box.Of course,I could not recommend this product to anyone...most disappointing purchase!",Negative
"Purchased these for a new Heritage H-575 arch top.  A few months later, the high E string unwound from the ball end.  Overall good strings, good sound -- this set simply didn't last very long.  I will replace with 12s however.  For me the 11s felt a little loose.  The 12s will likely improve the sound of the jazz box.  I have 12s on an Epiphone Joe Pass model.  I'll be curious to hear how the 12s sound incomparison to the 11s.",Negative
"The version I picked came with a grounding wire, claiming that using the wire in conjunction with the brush would discharge all of the electrostatic-producing snap, crackles, and pops.  If you believe that, continue to do so, and maybe you'll imagine less surface noise than was the case before employing the device.  Speaking more pragmatically, I've found some use for the item only when loose, conspicuous debris has collected on the surface of a vinyl disc.",Negative
"I purchased these as well as the Jim Dunlop 7000 locks.  I recommend the 7000 model.  They both work the same way and are made pretty much the same way, but these are just to big and clumsy.  The 7000 model does the same and doesn't take as much space.  You will need the straps to either be thin at the ends or your strap buttons/pegs to have enough room for the strap and then these units.  This is true for either one of the models.  I have a regular nylon 2&#34; Levy strap and these two models (7000 and 7007SI) work well, but I prefer the smaller, rounder model (7000).",Negative
"They only fit if you have enough room in your strap button, if not they will just pop right out. I threw mine away.",Negative
"I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic.  The guy at Dunlop told me ""oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic"".  That is NOT the case.  I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth.  But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product.  It's called, TRAIN your people!!!",Negative
"Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps.",Negative
"I bought this capo thinking it would look slicker without the clamp handles sticking out but what I found is that although it looks cool, it's complicated (which for a capo is saying something). The release lever makes it difficult to get a good amount of pressure on the strings and nearly impossible to put it at the top of the guitar when not in use.Bottom line: If you don't mind the extra effort and don't plan on keeping it on your guitar when not using, then maybe you will enjoy it. For everyone else, look elsewhere.",Negative
"Barring any interference from any other devices or radio stations broadcasting on the same frequency and any manufacturer's defects ... the unit does what it was meant to do. I do however question whether the word ""Pro"" should apply to this system. Although the 1/4 inch mono plug that comes with the receiver offers the ability of plugging directly into most powered speaker systems or to a mixer, the overall quality of the audio brought back memories of mornings standing outside the classroom with my schoolmates and listening first to the national anthem being played and then announcements coming out of the pa system. The signal does experience some fading when the transmitter is moved about. To its defense, it is fighting against a radio music station broadcasting at near band frequency which can be received if the transmitter is off or further than 25 feet away.After playing with the device for a couple more minutes, I noticed that any movement whether I kept the receiver and transmitter stationary and I moved about my home or moved just the transmitter about severely affected the quality of the reception. Even the length of the mic cord, whether wound up or straight or even just gathered around the sending unit had an adverse effect on the sound output quality. YIKES!!! Perhaps its because of the competing signal its receiving from another source which I previously described above. I'm afraid this would not be a very usable and dependable device for my purposes. I'll probably be returning this unit asap.",Negative
"I bought this because--hey, a wireless mic for $13? Why not? I *might* be able to use this in a public address system--the connections all work, and it makes sounds, but the static is unbearable no matter how much I fiddle with different, the adjustment screw in the receiver... nothing works. The audio is always clipped. Don't even think of using this for music.",Negative
"Arrive, in trashed packing, but the worst was that it sounded like a piece of chalk on a blackboard... certainly NOT professional quality or any quality that I would give it.",Negative
I got these for a custom les paul 5 string bass I had built and one of the locks broke off after a month and a couple of uses. Also the locks were quite uncomfortable to use. I had never used strap locks before and don't think I will again.,Negative
"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.",Negative
"No where on the description does it say that the mic clip is NOT included.  The only place is on the box AFTER you have received the item.  There's no instruction (which is fine). But in the product description it doesn't say that you must purchase the mic clip separately or you can't use it.I bought this and have it shipped second day because I need to use it and now I can't because it doesn't come with a Mic Clip which I have to spend another 5-10 to get it plus shipping.  The price is the stand is reasonable had it included the mic clip.  But without it, I felt cheated.",Negative
"The only reason I'm not giving this one star is that I didn't expect much for such a low cost pedal. I got this for one of my guitar players so he could use it to switch between clean tones and distortion at our rental practice space before he gets the money to buy a halfstack and decent sounding pedals. We have a punk ska band (think suicide machines, sublime) and need to switch a lot in all our songs. I thought this pedal would get us by someway in the meanwhile. NOPE. This pedal sucks your guitar's tone, and you have to turn the knobs all the way to get anything going, and its not a pleasant sound either way. AVOID.",Negative
"I purchased this as my first guitar slide. I loved it for about one month, then it fell off my finger and shattered into tiny pieces. I almost cut myself! I will never buy a glass slide again, I recently bought a Dunlop brass slide and love it. The difference between glass and metal is that glass is a muddier, mellow tone, and glass is crisper, louder, and does not break. I would not suggest this to anyone. The metal ones are about the same price, they don't break, and sound way better. There's a reason ALL pros use metal! The review below is wrong. Slides are meant to cover your ENTIrE finger, all the way to the tip. You don't bend your finger to play slide. You retune your guitar to an open tuning. Just thought I would point that out.",Negative
"Cheap crappy strap. It's too stiff, not comfortable at all. I regret purchasing this... Save your money, go hunt for a Coach strap or something similar. They are expensive but worth it.",Negative
"This is my first guitar belt, it is not a good fit, the connection to the guitar is far too thick, I try to not remove it too often as it is highly inconvenient and hard to manage.  Other than that it is usable, sort of, but I am thinking of getting some kind of metal hook instead, the thick leather is so unpleasant to deal with.",Negative
"I've two of these stands. On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND. BEWARE! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................China. That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it.

"My problem is that I am used to playing Hohner Golden Melody and Special 20 harps.  I guess I should have paid attention to the other 1 and 2 star ratings.  These harps have no volume.  Don't waste your money on them.  I guess the only thing worth having is the case, but the case has no handles or carry strap.5/25/14 - I said the case had no handle, well I take that back.  There is a little strap inside that prevents the case from opening flat.  I was able to fold that little strap outwards and then zip the two zippers up to it.  With one finger I can carry the case with my quality harps inside.",Negative
Disappointing; was looking for to receiving these.But; mostly they are unplayable. Leak air badly. Easier learning bagpipes than these things.Save your money and get some harps that actually work.Decent case though.,Negative
"I have other harmonica's but thought I'd like a set of blues harps.  I thought that if it's made by Hohner, it must be fairly good.  Wow, was I wrong.  Too hard to push notes through them.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.",Negative
"Crikey, where to begin. Firstly, I hated the fact that they package two strings to a paper packet. Secondly, they mismarked one of the packets, so it appeared I had two &#34;D&#34; strings, instead of two &#34;E&#34; strings. Lastly, and certainly the least favorably, once tuned up, the strings sounded terrible! They were tinny and clangy sounding. I've never heard worse strings. Fortunately, I had bought a package of Ernie Ball Earthwood med. light, as well. I replaced the godawful Martins with the Ernie Ball's and they were far, far better! Shame on Martin for such a piss poor product. I'll never buy their strings again.",Negative

"Dampit was recommended to me by a guitar instructor years ago, and I have used the standard model for some time. It seemed kind of tricky to get it to hold enough water to humidify the guitar yet still get it dry enough to have absolutely zero drips inside the instrument.I used to hang it by the clip and let it drip dry for about 15 minutes while I was doing other things before placing it in the guitar.Later I wound up trying the Humidipak humidifiers and to help recharge them on a Dreadnought, I took to putting the Dampit in a gallon plastic bag with distilled water and a resealable top, pressing on the sides to saturate it, then rolling it up in a Planet Waves Microfiber polishing cloth and pressing on the end of the cloth to soak it. Then unroll the cloth, put the dampit in under the headstock where a drop of water would just go into the hard shell case, then rolling up the end of the polishing cloth to cover the wet end with dry material and pushing it into the sound hole over the humidipaks. Worked great.So I ordered a super dampit for my new 000 acoustic planning to do the same. They now ship without the clips. Company says they've had too many complaints about scratches, though I didn't seem to have a problem, wasn't about to take a chance with a costly new acquisition. More importantly, there is supposed to be a sponge to absorb water inside the tube and when I pressed on the sides of the tube, it was empty. So I sent it back to Amazon for a refund. No problem getting the refund, but I'm moving on from dampit to try the planet waves insert with a sponge that has eliminated the chance of water dripping in the guitar or damaging the finish.If you use it to soak the polishing cloth as described above, that still works great, but there's really not enough room for that in the OM model, so between that and the missing sponge, will just try something else.",Negative
"I wanted to like this. I really did. The idea of an amp this portable and cheap just made me think, &#34;Perfect&#34;. However, the unit I received was cr@p, and I'm going to assume it was defective and not blanket all the positive reviews with dispersions. The one I got kept cutting in and out. You might be playing a solo line and you might hear about 75% of the notes or something. And when holding a chord, the sustained sound would cut out after a few seconds. Frustrating.I did weigh whether or not to try a replacement unit. The so-so sound and overall quality however didn't compel me to give it another go. Bummer. Any suggestions for an amp of similar size and portability?Cheers",Negative
"The only instrument this works well on is my Yamaha guitarelele which has nylon strings, for steel strings I want more pressure, I advise getting the NS Capo that is not ""lite"",  I prefer that one above this model.",Negative
"I ordered one of these because I like my other Planet Waves Capo a lot (I believe its the older metal version of this, not the &#34;Lite&#34;). However, this one just does not screw down enough to hold down the strings, especially down at the lower frets where the neck is a little thinner (on a Martin jumbo acoustic). It will barely bend the strings down behind the fret but not enough to prevent buzzing. Your fretting hand will naturally push the capo back and out of position quite easily when playing open chords too.I'm not sure why the plastic version has this issue when it appears to have an identical design to the old metal one. It doesn't seem defective as no parts are bent or missing as far as I can tell. Unless I just happen to get one with a shorter than normal screw, I wouldn't recommend it for any guitar without a thick neck.My recommendation is the classic Kyser capo thats more dependable and quicker to apply and remove (it also attaches to your headstock effortlessly when not in use). If you are looking for the screw-down style, I would look for the older version of this and avoid the &#34;Lite&#34;.",Negative
"It is inexpensive but is difficult to use  anywhere with other noise..I used it for several years but it is only a backup now.. Nice part is that you can calibrate the tuning, although probably would not be used by most musicians.. Other than that I think money would be better spent on a headstock type tuner.. I would not recommend it.",Negative
It doesn't seem to work. I think maybe mine was damaged or something because it doesn't seem to absorb any water.,Negative
"The sheets seem to work fine to polish the frets but the template is cut from the cardboard box which obviously isn't going to last long.  Also, trying to hold the cardboard on the neck is a pain and my finger is killing.I'm going to go buy a fret eraser and be done with it.",Negative
The Chorus is subtle... but it seems lacking to me. It is subtle but really weak compared to the classic rich ibanez chorus i have.,Negative

"I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this.",Negative
"It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.",Negative
"This system works just okay.  Try to turn it up and you get bad feedback.My microphone stopped working shortly after I purchased this item.  I contacted Pyle to see about a replacement and got nothing but runaround from them.They couldn't give me a price for repair or to purchase a new one, or where I could even buy a replacement.Very frustrating!",Negative
"I have had this tuner for about half a year and frankly, I have had enough.The main problem with this tuner is the usability.The tuner has a poor display, is extremely finicky and it does not display the octave of the key.Tuning with it can be condensed into one word - frustrating.The needle is very finicky and jumps all over when ever I pick the strings, especially so when the guitar is much out of tune.The poor display is dark, with no build-in light, and has poor visibility at angles too. Combine all that you have a terrible, accurate tuner.Yes, it is accurate but only as accurate as what the graph can display, which is +/-2 cents.Enough said, I bought a new tuner, the Seiko SAT800, for a bit more money that this.The main differences between SAT800 and the CA-40:SAT800 has a build-in light, CA-40 does not.CA-40 has a build-in stand at the back to prop it up to a 45deg angle, SAT800 does not.SAT800 has a auto and manual mode, CA-40 has auto.SAT800 displays the octave of the note, e.g. 1E, 2E, etc, CA-40 displays only displays the alphabet, E for all oactaves.SAT800 has a numerical display for the cents off, CA-40 does not.The needle graph on the Seiko is much more stable and it is just way more usable overall.I wholly recommend you do not purchase this tuner. I was fooled into buying it by the other reviewers on Amazon and I hope you would not be.",Negative
"This tuner works fine for the flute and clarinet however for things that use the input jack it doesn't really work. As soon as I insert any cord into the jack it automaticly goes to a very low B flat and stays there... Even if the guitar and bass are not on the other end. At first I thought it was my cord however after four cords doing this, I also tried other tuners with the same cords and they worked fine. So again works good on the sound input but poorly with cord input.",Negative
"I've been very disappointed with this tuner. When I've used it the needle keeps jumping all the way to the right(sharp) then back to the left(flat). I have two(2) other tuners I bought from Wal-Mart and I always get accurate tunings from them.  I bought this KORG because it's a brand name and the Company has an outstanding reputation. Even though my tow(2) Wal-Mart tuners are older, they both still work better than this KORG.",Negative
"There are better tuners out there. Far better. This could be good, but it seems to me that all Korg products seem to think of Standard tuning as the only tuning out there, and they don't even tune it well to Standard (especially when tuning the G string)! I personally play exclusively in Standard for my electric playing, but sometimes I want to fiddle around with open-tunings on an acoustic. This piece-of-junk makes it incredibly difficult to tune to any tuning using ""F"" or ""C"" notes. I have no clue as to why that is, pretty stupid if you ask me, especially once you consider that majority of this generations guitarists are metal heads playing in drop c tuning or acoustic d-bags (I say that with love) that play in open tunings. Trust me, your money is best spent elsewhere.",Negative
This would have been a nice slide if I could get it on my finger.  I'm borderline skinny and it still won't fit.  Save your money unless your under 10 years old.,Negative
"Lets face it, in general string winders are pretty much all the same right? WRONG! I went with this one because I trusted the Dunlop name. What a let down. on the second guitar I used it on the handle and the head separated, sure you can press it back together, but after separating several times on every string, it gets a little old....quick. Already ordered a different one to replace it. One thing I cant stand is inferior tools.",Negative

"This strap is uncomfortable and too flimsy to feel good, also doesn't fit an instrument where there's no place to hook it .  I returned mine, as it just didn't fit well for my uke or mandolin.",Negative
Sorry Fender...this one is just a waste of money.  Get something better that doesn't twist up an ravel into knots.,Negative
"Don't know what I expected for such a cheap price, but this product's quality is in line with its price. Also, the fit over my ukulele's fretboard is very tight, making it hard to put on and remove.",Negative
"This one is probably closer to a $150 guitar. The fit and finish is quite nice but at the end of the day it's just like most of the other made in China guitar. From the reviews I was really hoping this was some great gem for only $200, but I'm not at all impressed. One thing that bothered me is that these guys make everything from guitars to jet skis - which usually means they're a jack of all trades but a master of none.I recently bought a Johnson JG-610-N, a Johnson JG-620-N, a Bristol BD-16, a Jasmine S35, and this Yamaha. If I'd only played the Yamaha I'd probably think it was a pretty nice guitar, but having tried all of these side-by-side I can definitely say it's not at all amazing. The Bristol blows this thing out of the water, and not just because it's $50 cheaper, it plays and sounds better. The Johnson guitars both have a little higher action, not a lot of highs, and a cheaper fit and finish. The Jasmine is nice but I haven't spent enough time playing it to give a true review.The Yamaha FG700GS is definitely neat to look at, and has decent mids, but doesn't really have a great high to low end punch. Now, it it quite a bit wider at the bottom so it has some more body, but, the sound range overall wasn't great. The Bristol has great highs and plenty of deep lows in comparison. Also, the fretboard felt a wee bit thicker on the Yahama, though putting them next to the other guitars it looked about the same.Can't help but think that the reviews here are a bit ""hive mind"" where everybody buys into a hype. Maybe I got a dud guitar, but I doubt it, they're all made in the same factory.",Negative
I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input. The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier. With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp. They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. I am returning it.,Negative
"The mixer is good for the price but I had to return my first one soon after opening it due to some loose parts moving around inside. The packing way below average. As a matter of fact, it was the only outer box without any cushioning. After seeing those UPS and FEDEX delivery videos I would not pack a UPS or FEDEX shipping item in such a poor packing. However, the great seller ( I am referring to AMAZON) immediately responded and sent me a replacement along with a prepaid label to return the fist unit. Second unit too had the similar packing but no damages. Worked fine.",Negative
"Considering the price is so cheap on these, I took a chance on this about a year ago for my home hobbyist studio. To say that I used it ""rarely"" is an understatement - maybe once a month when I have friends over for jamming as a way to get my vDrums and a bass DI through my powered wedges. That said, within a year two of the channels stopped working altogether, and the main volume fader became scratchy and jumpy to the point that the volume all the way down would = the volume ALL the way up.Aside from it not working less than a year later, as others have mentioned the lack of a power button combined with the wall wart adapter is a bit of a pain as well. However, if you're building a studio on a budget and want to roll the dice, it's a decent little mixer while it works.Pass on this - sound quality is decent for the price, but reliability gets a zero.",Negative
"This pedal, in short, sucks.  There's no point to having an A/B pedal if it adds a huge amount of hiss to your sound. Behringer needs to go back to the drawing board with this.",Negative
"I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this.",Negative
"It's a decent unit, but stopped working completely after about 6 months. Tried everything I could, but it's gone. I would not recommend this pedal.",Negative
"Behringer pedals are really cheaply made and the feel amazingly light, cheap and unable to take the riggors of gigging. I just didn't want to spend $100 on the Boss version, but you get what you pay for! Another thing that I hate is it's really hard to change the battery, unlike the Boss pedals. save your money and steer clear of this one. I also bought a Behringer power amp for $200 that lasted a few gigs befor it crapped out.",Negative
"if you go very high with the boost in frequencies, you will get noise in significant quantities. too noisy to please me for anything except experimentation. Pay the extra money and get something quiet. Others complained about this and they were right. If you want to experiment with equalization, its good and cheap. Some complained about each band boosting others. This is more of a user problem than manufacturing. If you want to isolate a frequency range, boost that range and then cut the ones before and after it and you'll get a narrow range. In this respect, its like an MXR 6 band.",Negative
"Bought this because of all the great reviews, ButThis doesn't work, just like the last Beringer product I bought. Will I ever learn? Very disappointing.UPDATE- Now working; got my mate an Aussie genius to have a look.Found pedal wasn't engaging when pushed down.Took plastic cover off and pressed black button with his pinky and light came on; sheer genius.Worked fine with cover off; then replaced cover with new bit of rubber.

"Ok I understand it now - I use Abelton Live 8 and thought this would be and easy, read cheap, interface to record some instruments with. WRONG! I am returning it. It does not work, has no drivers and is not detected on my Mac (my Mac finds everything). Bought the Focusrite unit instead. Got it to work on garage band but latency was miserable and so was hiss on recordings. Save your money and time. Buy the Focusrite interface or one of the others. Yes over $100 but you either want feedback, hiss and frustration or you want a smooth interface connection with good resonance. It also lacks 1/4 plug, one rca input, you need an addapter.

The price was less than ten bucks, but unfortunately it doesn't work very well.  The microphone inside the unit is simply not very accurate.  It gets you in the ballpark, but just barely.  Strike a note once, and it's sharp.  Play the same note with the same force again and it says you are in tune.  I think the Korg tuner is in roughly the same price range and it performs the job much better.",Negative

"I bought this pedal new, hoping to get an electric solid body guitar to sound somewhat like an acoustic guitar on stage.  I knew going in that it would not sound like a Martin D-28, but I thought it would be good enough to play a couple of acoustic parts without having to switch guitars.Imagine my profound disappointment.Really, Boss??? This is by far the worst pedal I have ever used of yours.  This thing has a terrible hiss when you turn the ""Top"" control higher than about 9 o'clock.  At first I thought I must have a defective unit, but then I started reading reviews on-line.  Seems like it is part of the design. It's too bad because one can hear some promise in the faux acoustic tones, hidden beneath a wall of fizz. Totally unusable, as far as I'm concerned. By the way, I tested it direct to a PA as well as into a guitar amp with a single coil guitar (strat).",Negative
"SummaryAcoustic sounds &#34;ok&#34;, but noisy in weird ways. I returned it. Price seems high for what it is and vs. alternatives in the marketplace.Pros- Boss case is metal, mechanical design is durable- standard 9V power, and the power jack is on the back where it belongs.- variety of acoustic sounds possible. (personally, I only thought 1 of them sounded realistic at all though)Cons- fizzy noise integrated with notes played (or chords)- generally kind of noisy in the pedal chain- While I have several Boss pedals, I think they always make the knobs too small and the font/print too small. I prefer pedals with larger and fewer knobs that can be tweaked with your toe if needed while playing.Details:The basic concept is good. I had an AC-2 (prior model) and sold it because it had a noise problem where there was a fizzy noise when you play a note. It wasn't in between the notes or when not playing, it was integrated with the sound of every note you played (or chord) and you could not filter it. It was also just noisy in the pedal chain. Adjusting your guitar volume down for higher gain pickups helps some. However, I sold that model because I didn't want the pedal in the chain with everything else and I wasn't happy with the sound. At the time, the AC-2's were selling for about $85 new. Boss since redesigned AND raised the price significantly on the AC-3.I bought the AC-3 hoping they had improved the issues of the AC-2 -- and they did, a little. But not enough to keep it. I returned it after a week because it still has the same basic issues, just not as pronounced. I think the AC-3 could work for gigging, but there are other choices that sound as good for $25 instead of $130 to $150 (with tax and/or shipping) so to me, the boss pedal is overpriced and not that great.I opted for a Behringer acoustic modeller instead. They make two -- a &#34;300&#34; and a &#34;400&#34;. The 400 has reverb on the pedal. I opted for the 300 and got it for $25. I expect the durability will be lower on the Behringer than the Boss as it has a plastic case. However, this is an effect I pull out just once in a while and since I can buy 4 or 5 or 6 Behringers for the price of a Boss....if it breaks...I'll just buy another.I also have a Boss GT-100 multi-effects unit. You can get the same or similar acoustic modelling sounds out of that, out of the Behringer or out of the Boss AC-3. The least cost effective of those choices is the AC-3 - and it has noise issues the other two don't have.I'm not saying its a bad pedal, I'm just saying it wasn't the best choice for me when considering the cost, the sounds, and my usage model. If they would fix the noise issues, I might have even kept it. I did opt to keep the Behringer for those times I'm using a discrete pedal board and want an acoustic model effect. This Boss pedal just didn't work that well for me.",Negative
"I bought this pedal as a companion to my Roland AC-33 Acoustic Amp.  The pedal on its face looks like a good piece of equipment and feels quite sturdy.  However you do have to use a 9 volt batter to make it operate.  This is totally unnecessary for a foot-switch.  The worst part is the leads on the battery connector (9 volt) were not properly soldered or had shorted out.  The only way I could get it to function was to let the 9volt battery dangle just right and connection would be made.  For the rather high asking price and the limited function that is needed (i.e. all that has to work are two switches and a battery) you would think that Boss would put out a better product.  I also found that the battery cover was extremely cheap and was difficult to close, leading me to believe that the durability of the cover was in question.  I would HIGHLY recommend that you look to another maker for a switch or consider constructing one yourself with readily available parts that can be purchased on this site.",Negative
"When I purchased this I'd seriously hoped that it would make a real difference to the tone of my guitar. Guess what? As far as I can tell, there is no difference whatsoever between this saddle and the original the guitar came with. This is NOT worth the money.",Negative

And the cable included in this pack, well, the plastic (not metal) connector to the mic was cracked.  I still tried it with a difference mic... static.I can't blame Amazon for the broken bits as the whole thing was packed well and the box did not appear damaged.The stand that comes with this set up seems really good for the price of the whole package.

"The Good:This is a good tool to practice guitar with headphones.The Bad:The tones are not good by any stretch of the imagination, unless you like hyper-distorted noise.  The cleans sound artificial and the crunch tones have obvious digital distortion applied.  The effects are hit and miss as well.  Plate reverb is decent but spring reverb is so artificial sounding that it's downright offensive.Throw in the fact it chews through batteries, the software interface you use to program it on your computer is really difficult to use, and how it loses its small-and-portable-factor with a guitar cable, headphone cable, and power adapter plugged into it, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend this product unless you really need to practice through headphones.",Negative

"I heard great things about the S6 and so, being a novice without any idea of what to buy, I bought it based upon reviews. I've played it for a year, and after spending many hours in guitar stores comparing guitars, here are my (humble) thoughts:- The Seagull is comparatively unattractive. Its snake-head headstock with the tiny, not-great tuners looks out of place on a dreadnaught guitar.- The cedar top is very nice looking, and the rosewood fretboard/bridge on mine are very nice.- The laminate sides/back seem much thicker than competing guitars, and this makes the guitar heavier and, to me, less &#34;alive&#34;/resonant during playing.- The satin-finished cedar top is very easy to marr.- The cedar is warm at low to mid strumming force, but at a heavy strum, the top seems to bottom out and lose definition.- The treble sounds tinny to me and the bottom end seems muddy.- The frets are smaller than competitors but are OK.- The binding is a sharp 90 degree angle without any radius to it so it cuts into the chest and arms after playing - something I've not encountered before.- I can get the action very, very low before the frets rattle - nice!All in all, it is an OK instrument that stands out simply because it's made in Canada for Asian/Mexican prices - that said, just because it comes from Canada doesn't embody it with mystical vibes. In fact, for the price range, I can get a just-as-good Asian/Mexican guitar with a nicer laminate back/front, Sitka spruce solid top wood, better tuners, and a more attractive headstock - with a gloss finish for durability and that sounds just as good.I don't regret getting it, but I feel like I overpaid for what I received, and while the brand might have been a great deal at last decade's exchange rates, I have seen much better guitars in shops for the same price. Seagull to me is over-hyped.Thanks for reading!",Negative
"It sounds very artificial, I remember first getting this pedal and really loving the sound and kick it had, now that I use it with a better amp, it sounds very processed and artificial in sound that it's not even worth the price I payed for it before.

I am a tone freak. I bought this pedal a while back under the impression that it would sound equal to a big muff. At the time i had never owned a big muff. I thought the sound it produced was big muff sound. I later took it to my friends house and matched settings with a real big muff. The difference was huge. The big muff sounded fuller where the little one sounded like you just took the sound and trapped it in a little box. I later bought a big muff and its been one of my go to pedals for at least three years of gigging. I am currently loving it still but i am curious about the nano big muff because i am looking to clear out space on my board but i will probably not use it if it sounds anything less than the real deal. I would only use the little big muff if my concerns for sound were out shined by the need to minimize board space,Negative

"These cans were decent, back when they were just above 100 bucks. They've inflated to 160 and that's just ridiculous. There is better in this price range. The SRH840's for example on eBay for 120~ bucks new, does everything better than these cans. The M50's have really punchy bass, and extremely stringent highs, they're very loose in the low end, and their mids are recessed. That combination makes for a fatally tiring listening experience. The pads are pleather and terribly uncomfortable, whilst having an almost starchy texture to them. The headband clamps onto larger heads and lacks decent padding underneath. These phones are also terrible in regards to any soundstage at all, which means for gaming, these will be pretty terrible. They do some... SOME... new genres alright, but their extremely aggressive presentation makes these phones just hard to listen to. They also can't do lighter genres like Jazz and Classical due to their poor positoning. There are much much better monitors in this price range than these, the Shure SRH840 as I've said before totally outclass these headphones in all areas.Stay away, don't fall victim to the noob hype.",Negative

"If you want to use this to power up a Tascam DR series digital recorder, I have a less expensive solution for you:  if you own a usb wall charger (like a cell phone charger), you can use that to power your device through its usb port.

"I purchased this after reading many favorable reviews online and it seemed like a good unit for the price. After trying to use it I promptly returned it. I do sound for concerts and wanted a recorder to connect to the sound board to record shows.  I have used a minidisc recorder to do this but wanted something that would easily inferface with my computer.  I tried recording on the H2 using it's line in jack and recording from a line out or tape out my Mackie sound board or my stereo receiver.  No matter how I set the levels the recording on the H2 was very distorted.  I played with the record levels and the AGC and limiter functions and tried recording from several different audio sources and always got a very distorted signal.  I have used my minidisc for the same application for many years and have never had a problem and have always got very clean, good quality sound.  The problem with my H2 was that the gain on the mic and line inputs appear to be the same and are meant for a mic level signal, which caused any line level signal to overdrive the preamp. Recording from the internal mics seems to work fine.  I have worked with professional sound equipment for over 25 years and the Zoom recorders are the only brand where I have found this problem.The H2 has a nice menu set up and the instructions are very easy to follow but if you want good line level recordings, look for something else.  I exchanged this model for an H4n and it had the same problem recording a line level signal, but not as bad as the H2.  I finally ended up getting the Tascam DR-07 which I am very happy with.  It has a few less bells and whistles but appears to overall be a better quality recorder.",Negative
"If you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely. But it's a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other. There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall.

"I have finally learned my lesson.I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say ""good for static applications"" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work.A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple ""does it work yes/no"" is clearly not good enough, as i learned",Negative
"Be careful; I have a small recording studio, so we put our cables through a lot, and these guys just don't last. They were fine for the first few months, but then they started to die like a murder mystery. Seriously, one after another they would just go, for no apparent reason.Fine one second, and then it would just go horribly staticky. I actually had two blow at one time, and thought my PA was shot. Thankfully, it was just these cables. NOT GOOD. Spend a little extra on another brand. These have been my favorite:GLS Audio 25ft Cable Cords",Negative
"i got this despite the warnings about it being too short for some people.  The strap is about 6"" too short for my Seagull S6 guitar.  I will say the build quality is great but too short, is and remains, too short.  I will keep this item and take it to a shoe shop or saddle repair place and have and extendo put into the strap.  I just can't understand how they can sell this a a guitar strap when it is clearly too short.2/22/2013 I fired off an email to LEVY and the long and ""short"" of all this is you will have to fork over another $30 to buy an extendo for this strap. I don't quite understand why they don't make the strap long enough to start with other than the fact they can extract another $30 to make it work right in the first place.  here's a link to the extendo optionLEVY'S LEATHERS MMGXL-2.5-BRN STRAP EXTENDER http://www.amazon.com/LEVYS-LEATHERS-MMGXL-2-5-BRN-STRAP-EXTENDER/dp/B00BH5N91E/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1361565768&sr;=8-2&keywords;=MMGXL-2.5  the irony here is I managed to buy the last one for the immediate future.This is just another case of caveat emptor for all buyers to consider. I got the extendo strap and it does not match the original so now I have this cobbled up looking guitar strap. It's sort of like wearing a suede shoe on one foot and a polished leather shoe on the other.  I will keep this strap but sure feel like I've been had on this purchase... the terms bait and switch come to my mind.",Negative

"I have no idea what happened or if anyone else had this problem, but I got literally 8 plug-ins, and not the part where you can plug in an existing cable to make this into a chain. It's like I got an extension cord and male outlets on both ends. Soooo it's pretty much useless to me. I guess if you get one of those power blocks with 9v outlets on them, I guess you could plug this into it but I really see no point. I would've shipped it back I lost the packaging and just wrote it off as loss. I think I payed like $8 for it so whatever. I would recommend going to an actual music store so you can physically see both the male ends and the female end.",Negative
"I ordered this plug because it is advertised as a &#34;1 Spot&#34; brand plug. It is not what I received. Instead I received a generic plug  for eight 9v connections that would definitely fit the purpose, but a really cheap version. The plugs on this generic version are larger than the 1 Spot and the wires are kind of stiff plastic. The original 1 Spot plug has much smaller plugs, great for saving space on a pedal board, and the wires are soft and &#34;rubbery&#34;, again making it easier to work with on a pedal board, specially if you're working with a pedal board like Pedaltrain where you can intertwine wires in and out between bars. I informed the seller about the issue and was told it was a mistake and that they would send me the correct one. In my email to them I included an image of the original packaging of the 1 Spot 8 Plug to make sure there would be no mistake, but to my amazement they sent me another compatible plug. I emailed them again for a refund, which they promptly did. I can say, that they did respond quickly and they refunded my money. I imagine that those who order this plug without ever having worked with an original 1 Spot plug, wouldn't know the difference because although it is a really cheap version it does have eight 9v connectors. I strongly recommend, spend the extra two or three dollars and get the original 1 Spot 8 Plug.",Negative

"I give the product a 4star for doing what it is supposed to do. I give it a single star because it failed two weeks after the return period. Generously, I'll give it 2stars.

"I used AC30 for years, lost them, and decided to make a change and buy these.Sound quality of AC30 wasn't anything to write home about but had decent cleans and gains, but this one has a horrendous clean (tried with my strat and tele, play jazz/blues mostly), and mediocre gain, you can get a lot better sound even with the free amp programs for ipod and computers (buying a 25-35 buck connector cable), though, granted those tend to have feedback problems when you use certain gain-y settings.For people worried about CONSTRUCTION, these turned out to be very sturdy (AC30s i previously used did, but the built/materials are exactly same).Even if you're determined to settle for the mediocrity of phone amps, go for cheaper models, or simply buy AC30, the latter has acceptable cleans..",Negative

Bought this years ago. It was a nice long cable that I bought figuring it'd be durable but it didn't last. Maybe it was my mistreatment of the cable but then again it should be built to gig...

"These speakers worked great for 14 months. Last week (4/8/13), one of them wouldn't power up all the way. The problem is getting worse every time I try to use them, and it's just a matter of time before it stops working.  It seems there is a problem with the capacitors that I did read about in a few reviews. I took a chance on the monitors anyway, and it was a huge mistake. I only use them between 2 and 4 hours per week. I contacted M-Audio's online support system and was given addresses to two electronics repair shops. One on the East coast and one on be west coast. I've since found many complaints about this same issue all over the Internet and on the M-Audio support site. M-Audio doesn't stand behind their products, and I'll never purchase anything from them again.",Negative
"On the plus side, these monitors look and feel amazing.  They are coated in some kind of silky rubberized stuff and they are heavy and look neat.They don't sound horrible.  I mean, they are not computer speakers or anything.  The sound is very forward, I would say harsh.  That's not uncommon among studio monitors.  There is definitely a lot of clarity here.  Not a ton of bass, but that's pretty much understood from monitors with woofers of this size.  There's a few schools of thought on studio monitors.  Some people think they are basically for bringing out the warts in your music, others think they should sound more like a normal speaker.  These will be more pleasing to people interested in the first.  I definitely sounds like the music is right in your face when you are listening to this.  Any flaws would be quite noticeable.I previously used KRK RP8's so I can compare these to them.  Granted, they are larger and more expensive, although they are also budget monitors.  I liked them better than these.  They were clear but also sounded nicer and, of course, had much more bass.I was going to put a woofer on these and burn them in...see if I could improve the situation...BUT one of the speakers starts to buzz about 5 minutes after it's turned on.  The buzz increases in volume over time.  I tried moving them to a different location, turning the volume down, even disconnecting the audio feed (so they were only plugged into the power).  Nothing stopped the buzz.  If they are warmed up and you turn them off and then on again, the buzz starts up in more like 10 or 20 seconds.  So I sent them back.  I wasn't really impressed with the sound and I'm definitely not satisfied with the quality control, so I'm going to try some larger and more expensive monitors instead.  Maybe Behringer 3031a's or something.  I think it's worth an extra 200 dollars or so to get a full-sized monitor.",Negative
"Sound nice, but very unreliable BX5a Deluxe.I own a pair of YAMAHA NS 10s and EVENT 20-20s, and they are all currently working without problems with over 10 years use.2 years ago I purchased a set of regular BX5a's, and they lasted about 1 1/2 years, and then the faulty capacitors leaked.I just replaced them with the BX5a Deluxe model, and after only one week. one of the Internal amps will no longer power up.I need a pair of affordable AV shielded monitors that I can depend on, and these Cheap M-Audio Monitors are not it.I am back to using my 20-20's with slight AV noise until I find a decent AV shielded monitor.M-Audio was a much better company before Avid took them over!",Negative
"In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment.",Negative
"Good grip, but too flexible, and the description says nothing the thickness or the flexibility of these picks. Probably good for strumming, but not good for lead.",Negative
"This is an affordable copy of the Boss Harmonist pedal. I bought this mainly for the harmonist and polyphonic pitch shift feature. But was surprised by how much fun the trem bar and flutter mode was to play with.Anyway on the third day the tracking on the pedal suddenly started to have about a one second delay. And on fourth day in addition to the tracking problem, hitting certain notes caused a low pitch fluttering noise. Also the pedal just started oscillating a few times. I would have given the Behringer us600 five stars if it kept working, it tracked nice and didn't tone suck too bad.",Negative
"Some things are great values, others are cheap. The Behringer is cheap. The clips are cheap. The clip that holds the 9V broke after the first change. The clip that holds the pedal is also cheap plastic. IF you get stuck using batteries, plan on 3-4 hours worth of use. It's also a noisy pedal. Like noisier than my Dyna Comp and OD pedals combined. Like you will not record with this pedal in your chain unless you want a mountain of noise. If you leave it plugged into your cables, even when powered down, it will eat your batteries.All of those negatives aside, you are paying less than $40 for a Reverb pedal that has several usable features. The 63' spring is great, the plate is also really good. It also has a worth-the-price-alone ""space"" feature. Also known as shimmer (a synth playing behind your instrument). Paired with a chorus effect, you can get some really cool tones.The RV600 is not without merit, but it is a bargain effect pedal and it has some fun to use features. If you gig or record and need a reverb...well...you aren't even looking at this pedal. If you play at home and have a low watt amp that doesn't have a reverb built in, this is a good option.",Negative
"Had I known what I was getting I would never have ordered it.  There are gig bags and there are gig bags.  I've ordered and used inexpensive guitar gig bags.  I expected more. This one offers almost no protection.

"Unhappy with it, actually I already replaced them. The method of attachment is poorly designed, it doesn't matter how tight you screw the two sections of the lock with the catch balls, the thread slips and my guitar almost fell down to the ground in a couple of occasions. Expensive locks too.",Negative
"I had some issues with my 18-watt all tube amp so I experimented and replaced all the tubes.  Issues not only continued but worsened.  Hum, noise, volume fade, unwanted distortion at low volumes.  I eventually put back the original El84s and that didn't help.  Once I removed the Tung-Sol 12AX7 preamp tubes and replaced, the hum stopped, sound quality of the amp was consistent, quiet and back to par.  My experience with the Tung-Sol tubes was very, very negative.  They caused me to go out and buy another amp.  I had no idea that brand new tubes could sound so badly that fast.  I'll never buy this brand again.",Negative
"Don't buy this Chinese piece of crap if you really need a three guitar stand. It is barely workable for two.It is easy to set up, but the way the neck brackets are arranged you are only going to get two guitars comfortably on it and even then guitars can still slip off the stand even when you tighten the little rubber thingies on top to hold the neck in place. And you absolutely  have to keep that tight or your guitar will at some point turn sideways and fall to the floor/ground.The best thing these stands are built for are V Type guitars such as my Jackson Rhoads as long as you can put them back to back. For Les Paul and Strat type axes, their rounded lower bout curvatures make them prone to slipping on the narrow, stick like feet of the stand, especially when they are new. You can't tilt the feet up to try to lend more stability to the way the guitars hang because the feet won't support enough weight to make that possible. So this thing utterly fails in its designation as a three guitar stand. If you just gotta buy something from On Stage, get the double hang because there is more separation between instruments and so it ends up being better balanced. But really, you should just pass entirely on either the triple hang or the double hang.This is definitely a case of one gets what one pays for.",Negative
"This seems to have been a rare case but still, i had my ukulele on is and it snapped, I'm worried what might happen with a guitar or a bass",Negative
"I purchased this stand for my electric guitar and used it for a couple of weeks before the weak weld broke on the neck holder at the top when I placed my guitar in it. Upon close inspection, the weld was very poor and barely attached the neck holder to the upright tube. The tubing is made from very thin round steel tubing that is maybe .025&#34; wall, so don't expect it to take much abuse before it snaps off- even if it is welded better than mine was. Just folding the legs repeatedly back and forth will likely cause it to break or pop out one of light duty aluminum rivets on the legs- it is literally that thin of metal tubing.For $10-11 I did not expect perfection, so to it's credit- it is foam covered where it needs to be and has never scratched my guitars.This stand does have one other good quality- it is CHEAP! Since it was less that $11, I cannot see going through the hassle of returning it. I was able to carefully weld mine back together- but this would probably not be an option for most. The stand might work fine if you don't fold it up regularly and if you leave it set up- but If you need portability and durability- I would definitely purchase a better quality stand.",Negative
"This is a fantastic product that is well made. The plastic is heavy duty and comes with a plastic cover that must be removed before use. This ensures that the wheel you get is in perfect condition.The tool is extremely useful. I have just started playing with a band, and it is very common for band members to call out a song and the key that it is in. With the wheel, I immediately know what chords to choose from. I also know what notes are in each chord. In addition, it has a note by note image of the entire fretboard so that you can see where the roots are for the scale you are playing.The wheel is also invaluable for switching keys. For example, say you're playing the I, IV, and V chords in the key of C., but your lead singer is having trouble and would rather sing it in Bb. All you need to do is dial the wheel to Bb, find out the new I, IV, and V chords, and start playing. The wheel makes chord transposition a breeze.I feel that the negative reviews you are seeing are unfair. This is a very useful product at a fair price.No, I am not affiliated with the company at all. I'm just a band member newbie who appreciates this tool.In my opinion, this is a five star product.",Negative

"My issue with the Pedaltrain 2 is the accommodation of a power supply. I have a Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus.The documentation that comes with this pedalboard specifically states that this power supply mounts under the board, and it even includes mounting brackets that fit this power supply. However, if you actually try to mount it to the underside of the board as suggested, you're in for an unpleasant surprise.First of all, regarding the two circular holes on the front of the board. The fitment to the power supply is there... sort of. There's no way to align them perfectly because the holes on the pedaltrain 2 are slightly too close together. I wasn't worried about this, since I doubt I'll ever chain them and only have access to 1 outlet.The second issue is, the allegedly self-tapping screws that come with the mounting kit strip as though they were made of butter. Once you've got them in (or attempted to do so), they're never coming out. You'll probably have to break them. It's a shame to have cut corners on something so inexpensive.The main issue I have with this board relating to my Voodoo Lab power supply is this. Once you get the power supply mounted properly on the underside of the board (it can only go one place), you begin to plug in your pedals and you discover that the cables supplied with the power supply don't fit the mounting location on this board. You can't plug them in because there's not enough clearance between the frame of the pedalboard and the sockets the cables plug in to.I really only bought this pedalboard because of the supposed perfect compatibility with the Voodoo Lab power supply I own, but given that it doesn't fit like it's supposed to, I wish I could return this board - except I can't, because it now has holes drilled in it. (You have to drill the board to mount the power supply underneath it.)Basically, I paid $100 for a plain flat sheet metal metal rectangle and a couple rolls of velcro. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased.",Negative
"From the product description, I expected something far more robust than this unit. By and large, I've had great experiences with Behringer pedals, but this reverb unit is the wimpiest I have ever used in 40 years of playing - no stronger than the reverb in a 5w First Act amplifier.",Negative
"I bought one of these for a vintage Fender Showman that doesn't have built in reverb.  Put a battery in and plugged it in.  Very simple.  But the sound was horrible!  No setting delivered an effect that sounded anything like any kind of reverb I ever heard or would want to hear.  The closest I could get was a cheesy delay or echo effect that sounded awful.  On the other hand, the reverb from my Korg AX-100G (that I was using on another rig) was great.  Maybe my DR600 was not functioning properly, but I don't think so.  I think that's the way it really sounds.  So I got a return authorization from Amazon (very easy - never fails), put it back in the box and UPS picked it up the next day and I got a full refund.JM Tepper",Negative
"This ""would"" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb"".

The microphone end was a VERY shaky connection with the most intermittent power conveyed to the mic.Don't buy this item - spend the relatively small extra amount and get a more reliable brand.",Negative
"I bought this for a practice amp for my bass guitar. It showed up on amazon when I was doing a search for ""Bass Guitar amps"", other regular guitar amps were not showing up so I was curious about it. After a bit of searching online to see if a guitar amp would work for practice situations, I thought I would give it a try because some people say yes, others said no. I wanted to test for myself. While I did get sound and was able to practice, it didn't have anywhere close to the tone I was hoping for. So I ended up returning it the next day. I'm not upset about the amp itself, just that it shows up as a bass amp off the search, which is the only reason I gave it a shot. For a regular guitar, this would be fine but not bass. I which they would take bass out of the key words or whatever was in there to trigger this to show up. I was in the market for a practice amp for under $100 and was hopeful, but what I ended up doing was buying a used Acoustic B20 1X12 Bass Combo Amp for the same price as this new practice amp and I am a lot more satisfied. Again, this review is strictly on the aspect of a bass guitar, not regular guitar.",Negative

"Purchased it to use on a 00-28 slotted headstock Martin and it just didn't fit well for me. Also found it extremely difficult to attach and remove. A string style worked a lot better, was a lot easier to attach and remove, and provided a lot more options for where it good be placed.",Negative

"I have a real problem with these patch cables.  I got them as a christmas gift but they don't stay in my pedals' input jacks without causing problems and having to push them in on occasion.  Most problematic is the connection between my EHX memory boy and digital memory man... never had problems with any other cables here, but these refuse to stay put without having to constantly adjust.",Negative
"I thought it was my jack for a while, then I noticed it wouldn't stay in any pedal.  There is no ""click"" assuring that the cable is in place... and there's a reason for that, it isn't! Slips right out of every pedal I have.  Not reliable.",Negative
"These cables are excellent quality cables, however, if you are trying to patch your pedals together in a closely spaced setup, these cables are rather bulky and stiff.The large size of the right angle connectors requires you to space your pedals out more than you might prefer, especially compared to some of the other pedal patch cables that are available from companies such as Hosa.",Negative
"Bought it after read reviews. I had signal loss using these cables.. it's like having a loose connection inside the cable. My connections were on and off, I thought I had a dead pedal.. I have to wiggle and hold to get signal. It's too flexible almost like Twizzlers (no kidding!). If you want a cheap and reliable pedal cables, go get the one from Pro Co, I bought it very cheap from Sweetwater on Ebay, surprisingly very good quality and looks durable!",Negative
"I purchased the H4n after being unhappy with the H2's performance most significant where I couldn't record a good sounding signal that wasn't distorted with the Line In jack.  Only to find that the H4n has the same problem but not as bad.  If I try to record a line level signal from a sound board or stereo receiver and connect to the H4n's 1/4 inch jacks, it is almost impossible to not to have a distorted signal.  It appears that on both models the line in preamp is too sensitive and clips very easily and because it is clipping in the preamp, adjusting the gain doesn't correct it.  I contacted Zoom's tech support about the H2 and was told that I likely had a defective unit.  I returned the H2 and decided to give Zoom another chance and try the H4n after seeing many positive reviews.I really like the H4n's design, the menus and controls are nicely organized.  It feels more sturdy than the H2.  The recording quality using the built in mics is excellent.  Most other recorders in this price range don't have XLR inputs.  Since I plan to use it mostly for recording concerts by connecting to a line out or tape out on a sound board, if the line in jacks don't work properly and can't accept a normal line level signal without clipping, I can't use this for what I bought it for.  I have used my Sony minidisc recorder for the same type of application for the past 8 years and have never had any problems.  I've worked with pro sound equipment for over 25 years and have used many types of recorders and so far the Zoom products are the only ones where I have encountered this problem.  If you are using this to record with mics, it works great, but if you need to record from line level sources, the Zoom recorders may not be a good choice.  I exchanged this for the Tascam DR-07 and while the Tascam doesn't have as many bells and whistles, It is a nice recorder and I'm very happy with it.",Negative

"I really wanted this to be a great product.  The screws strip out too easily.  Basically, if you put a microphone in it, and ever have to use it for a microphone, it is going to strip out.  I had two of them and was hoping that the first one was a lemon.  Nope.  Even the pop filter fell off.  I LOVE the design, but they need to make them strong enough to handle the weight of a microphone and strong enough to handle regular studio usage... ex:  adjusting the position of the mic, picking up a mic stand and moving it, etc.  Otherwise, don't have an adjustable tilt option.  Just make it one solid piece.  I'm tempted to try to fix it with Gorilla Glue because I do love the design.  It's just not strong enough.  Not that it's a surprise though.  Not much of anything is worth the money these days.  It's a damn chore to return every friggin' purchase these days that they don't really have to care about actually testing products.  Why should they?  They already have your money.  I feel like I should get paid for testing their products and the time spent un-boxing and packing things back up.  Besides, what are they going to do?  Replace it with another broke a$$ product?  Better yet, refund my money for the product I paid - minus shipping????  That doesn't include the time I spent trying to prevent you from buying one and testing their damn product in the first place.  I want a refund, plus an hourly wage.  Whatever, don't buy one.  Companies that don't test their products don't deserve your business.

Is it ready to be sold to the public with confidence?Nope",Negative
"As soon as I attached my mic, and with my strong hands, I over twisted the mic holder on the threads, and the thread piece came loose on the stand.

"Ok, I'm surprised that this unit is now over $15.00.  I only spent $8.59 for this and I'm mad at myself.  It was cheap enough that I rolled the dice to see if I could get away with a decent product for CHEAP.  It feels solid, looks like a real direct box...but sounds like ass.  I couldn't believe that Pyle would put that much effort into a great ""fit and finish"" product, yet not put decent components inside.  This is the noisiest piece of crap I've ever used - I ended up buying another direct box (spent over $60.00).  Pyle has once again lived up to it's name, but they should finish the name properly and re-brand as ""Pyle of S***.""Sorry folks, but I'd skip this one.  The 5-star ratings must be from employees.

"Our family of 2 guitarists and 1 bassist switched to these style locks about a year ago.  Every one of us has had continual problems with the locks periodically unscrewing themselves from the guitar body. I had one back out during a gig and damage a brand new 60th Anniversary American P-Bass...not good. My son had one come out on him in the middle of a gig last weekend.The problem with the design is there's a ton of friction between the top and bottom pieces of the lock which results in the tab that's screwed into the body unscrewing itself.  We've tried applying bar soap, petro jelly, and a spray can based dry lubricant.... none of which prevented the ultimate forces that cause this phenomenon.We are switching to the Dunlop style locks as that design incorporates ball bearings which allows the strap to rotate freely back and forth with next to zero 'unscrewing' force.We tried to make the Fender/Shallers work but just could not.  Maybe we're all too active on stage but we cannot tolerate the equipment damage nor the performance distruptions these have caused us.",Negative

I say someone take a piezo transducer to amplify his guitar so I thought I'd try it. I first picked up a transducer for about $3 and experimented. I like it, sounded good then I saw this from Axl and I thought I'd try it. Installing it wasn't bad except I bought a set of drill bits I didn't need for $10. So I got it installed and plugged it in and from the start the sound was alright. I just wanted it for playing around at home so I didn't need real great sound quality. But sound was ok except it picks up every bang and knock especially my planet waves I think quick connect strap connector. My other complaint is I couldn't turn it up too loud without the feedback screeching. Overall product quality is good. Setup was ok. Price was good. Sound in my opinion needs some tweaking.",Negative
"The fact that it is passive really kills it. I just could not get any sound out of it, I tried multiple placements. I finally just bought a guitar with a pickup in it. Not worth the money, or the extra hole in your guitar.",Negative
This is a hit-or-miss product.  For me it fell short but for others it seems to work very well.  It's not a total loss since I can reuse the endpin jack with the soundhole solution I ended up with.  It was cheap enough that it was worth taking a chance on.,Negative
"I've been using primarily Alchemy strings for years but just got tired of spending so much for them. I figured I'd try some others at half the price and see if any stack up.These were the first to go on, and they were a HUGE step down from what I had on. The strings I took off were probably two months old an had spots of corrosion on the high E string. They were twice as loud as these. When you take these out of the pack, they sort of flop out like wet spaghetti. They don't do the fast unravel thing that strings typically do. The cons definitely outweigh the pros here.Pros:-Very flexible, string bends are easy-Easy on the fingersCons:-The most dull sound of any strings I've ever heard. Especially on the low end. They're dreadfully lacking in rich low end sound. The highs are very tinny. Almost sounds like a bad recording.-Your fingers stick when you try to slide down the strings. It's the weirdest thing. This is especially true for the G string. It's hard to explain, but it's kind of like rubbing against something really clean, where your hand does that skipping sort of rub and there's tons of squeak to boot. Anyways, it sucks. Grip is the last thing you want on your strings.Bottom line: Unless you have some wicked arthritis and just have to have super easy to bend strings, these should not be purchased. I'll never buy again. This is the first time in my life I wanted to change brand new strings.",Negative
"If you've never had a pedalboard before I'd say pass on this one and look for one that is more user-friendly.  The pics and description don't show just how insanely large this is.  It's too big.  Patch cables are crap and the power supply didn't seem sturdy enough to be kicked around.Besides this, I had trouble using it (even for practice) because the lip of the case gets in the way of my foot hitting the pedals.I ended up giving this one away to a friend and getting a Gator 'bone' and a seperate power supply.  Easier to practice with and easier to toss into another case with mics/cables rather than being a whole suitcase on it's own.",Negative
"I bought this amp back when i didnt know much about amps. If you want the metal sound for practice, then it is hard to get a better amp for one bill. But with the hybrid amps (Vibro Champ) going for not much more, you get better sounds and more settings. I am selling mine and ordered a Super Champ Xd used in new condition for two and a half bills. This Line 6 amp has a flat sterile sound that isnt very warm sounding. From now on its tube amps for me, even if i have to pay the price. A good tube amp should last a long time and hold its value well, too. Like i said, for a first amp at one bill, the Line 6 isnt too bad. Maybe some day i will be able to afford a Princeton Reverb?",Negative
"Before I purchased the FBV I scoured the web to see how it works with the POD HD Desktop, and even the advanced users guide leaves you thinking..Anyway, I lucked out and found a used one going cheap, and after some time figured out exactly what you can and cannot do with the POD HD desktop & FBV Express II combo.1. First, in the setup screen do NOT enable the FBV Express. Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but internet scouring shows there is a bug that this is a workaround for...2. Read the FBV Express users guide and calibrate the pedal.. there is no need to d/l the FBV software for this.Now.. In the POD setup screens you have the option to either have the ABCD buttons as ABCD, or to be FS5-FS8. This behavior is mimicked by the 4 switches on the FBV.So.. In ABCD mode you can:a) Select preset A, B, C or D from the group you are currently in.b) Insert a volume FX and use volume pedal...EXP2c) Insert another FX enabled by toe switch, and controlled by pedal as EXP1d) tap temp (by tapping the currently selected preset..ie the pedal that is lit)e) enable the tuner (press/hold the current selected preset pedal)f) you have some basic control of the looper, but CANNOT enable it.3/10/14 EDIT :Looper control is flawed. You can record and go to overdub, but you cannot record then play/stop the loop.. you can stop from overdub but not start the loop. seemingly an acknowledged and unfixed bugNice enough, but if you are like me, switching presets is way way less useful than switching FX blocks on & off. incidentally you can combine blocks such that one pedal (say) turns OD on, and delay & chorus both off, or turn one amp on and one off (channel switching).. YAY!! you cry, that sounds like me so its a NO to ABCD and mode FS5-FS8 it is for me!..SO yup in FS5-8 mode you can do that, you cana) enable/disable 4 sets of block(s) using the four pedalsb) use volume and expression options as above (ie like volume or wah, overdrive level, delay FB etc)c) basic control of looper BUT cannot enable itEDIT 3/19/14 looper control flawed as stated abovec) enable the tuner?...oh sod it. nope you can'td) tap tempo?.. nope not that either.So in summary, the Express is better than nothing, but certainly does not provide hands free operation of the desktop.. the shortboard is worth the extra, or if you are reading this before buying the pod.. get the HD500x instead.",Negative

"I was looking for a portable fold-up stand that I could take to gigs and searched around.  Found the Guardian at Amazon and thought for $10, how could I go wrong?  Oops! Wrong.  The stand is sturdy and folds up nicely, but I found it next to impossible to get my Fender Jazz bass to stand up in it.  The lack of an extended support for the neck means you have to try to balance the guitar very precisely against the apex of the stand and pray that no one gets near it or that the wind doesn't blow.

This pedal is ok at best there are a lot better metal pedals out there the only thing this one really has going for it is it has a built in noise gate other wise this pedal is pretty thin sounding and has far to much gain then you will ever need.

The most annoying thing was that they did not match each other. The locking mechanism was different on each stand and they were different heights. The holes in the inner poles were drilled  in different places so in order to use the support pins and have the speakers at the same height, you had to adjust the legs to accommodate the difference in height.

"For any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. Direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred Amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.That being said, it is good for practice and song writing. Used this for more than a year and finally sold it! That's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out.",Negative
"I bought an Ibanez Concert size uke.  The body is 2 inches wide (less than the 2.75 inches stated for this stand).  My uke does not fit well in the stand.  Why?  The twin forks at the base that hold the instrument are both too narrow, and the curve downward from the stand is not proper for this uke.  Thus, any uke that is concert size or greater.  So, most ukes don't fit well.  They fit, just not well.I did, and you will likely need this advice, remove the bottom fork, turn it upside down, and reinstall it (no tools required).  Now the ""curve"" of it is upward, and the uke better sits on it.  The fit is improved.  Not great but better.  One stand can't fit all instruments, but my full size guitar stands hold most all guitars.  This small stand does not hold most all ukes.Although its neat how it folds up, like the video here on Amazon reviews, it is very heavy for its size.  This is not a lightweight stand.  At all.  Surprisingly heavy, and not one that you will be lugging around day to day in your uke gig bag, trust me.I wish I got the Hercules standHercules GS402B Mini Stand. All Hercules stuff is superb, and my friend has one for his uke and says it's sublime (I don't own it, myself, so I just present this so you can research it and it's reviews on Amazon). I own other Herc stuff, and it's all ideal, and for a few bucks more, I could have had that lifelong-use stand instead of this one.  Oh, well, for once, I got cheap.  And got burned for it.All in all, not great, this tiny stand.  One stand fits NOT all.  Perhaps a violin or something would be better on this stand, but I think the general shape of it is less than ideal for most instruments.  You may think you can bend the lower forks, but it's hard to do, will require a vice, and if you see on the Amazon pictures, the lower fork just sits in two plastic grooves, so if you splay it out like it should be, you'll change the way it fits in the grooves, and thus it won;t work at all.  It's just an imperfect design. My take on it, your mileage may vary.  Bye bye.",Negative
"At the time I bought, was $16.  Mine arrived broken, so it had gone back.  Reality is that it is not that good regardless of mine being broken.  Not upset about that - stuff happens.  It is just not a good stand.  Light construcion, unstable (topples easily) and a likely candidate to be broken if dropped.  The 'protective' materails on the stand to keep product from scratching your instrument are the soft, shiny runner like materail and it 'sticks' to my instrument's neck.  So I pick up uke and I get a stand until the stickiness is seprated by gravity.  Happened every time.  Yes, I tried out the stand even though broken, and it proved to be a bad choice.  Back it has gone.  5 stars to Amazon's return policy, thouh!",Negative
"Let me first start off with the sizing. When they say ""Fits Soundholes from 33.75"" - 35"""", they really mean it.You are going to have a hard time trying to fit it even if it is 1/16"" smaller than the specifications.I know I did. My friend's Oscar Schmidt 3/4 sized guitar was just that much smaller and it did not fit well. The edges did not ""catch"" completely  and it looks terrible.My classical guitar had a similarly sized soundhole but because of the much wider fretboard at the edge of the soundhole, it did not fit at all. You could try cutting the edges off the Oport at the fretboard.The main issue is the sound.Yes, it does make the sound fuller when you are strumming, slightly but enough to tell.However, it does so at the expense of the sustain and harmonic overtunes.Fingerpicking just does not sound as nice as before, even though the guitar is noticeably better on the bass notes.For me, that does not justify it.A simple bone saddle does way better than this and it cost less.Another thing I found out was what was Amazon does to stuff others return - they resell as brand new if it looks brand new.The packaging on mine came slightly torn and looked as if it had been opened. Does it matter? In practical terms, no, not for this sort of item.I guess that is how Amazon keeps their prices low yet with good customer service and return policies.",Negative
"Perhaps it may do something of worth for you but if you have one of the finer made guitars this will probably do more to subtract than add to the sound. Be advised that I did not use it in front of a microphone where perhaps the shape of this internal plastic cone might do something you like in directing the sound to a mike. As strictly an issue of natural acoustics, I found it deflected sound in a way that seemed to decrease my guitar's output and resonance. I have an Aria AD-80 which is a very well-made Chinese attempt at cloning a Martin D-42. It can not compete with the real Martin but for the money I paid it was a great buy and it is known as a ""sound canon"" for it's great natural volume. Adding the O-Port deadened the lows. It just didn't provide any plus at all anywhere else. It is however pretty inexpensive so if you're a nut for nuance and you want to try it for yourself it's not going to break your bank. But again, if you have one of the better makes of guitar where a real person ""voiced it"" in his or her manufacturing process, this plastic gizmo will likely subtract from that and not add anything. I'm an acoustic nut and I'd love to have a sound port in the side of my guitar to hear everything that goes on inside that box. The O-port seemed to ""corral"" the sound and shoot it out that plastic horn not allowing me to hear some of the resonance of the sound bouncing back off the back and sides below the sound hole. Sorry to be a crab about it--I like Planet Waves stuff and they were very good to me personally in the ""Humidipak"" recall a few years back. But this product was a waste to me.",Negative

I ordered this from the Amazon warehouse as a refurbished item. It was properly packaged but the base was broken and poorly glued together.

Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it.

It also felt kinda fragile and chinsy. If you look, you can usually find the HD somewhere for $80; a $50 difference is significant, but the jump in quality (and likely longevity of the product) is definitely worth it. I upgraded and would absolutely do it again.",Negative
Bought this for a friend. Cheap plastic enclosure. Affects noticeably your guitars tone and is not exactly a useable delay. He tried to use it for his cleans for our punk ska band but there was no messing with the controls to get a suitable delay. Stay away from this one and get a better used pedal.,Negative
"My review(s) for this have changed a few times, but no more. When I first got it I liked the sound, though it did sound a little cold and digital, and this is from someone wanting to record shoegaze/dreampop, which by it's nature is full of cold tones (reverb/chorus/delay) shimmering, a la cocteau twins, chapterhouse, lush, so at first I thought it was great. Then the fuse software was even cooler, all this customizing the sound, though it did sound noisy and needed the compressor to take some of the noise away.After all of that I finally realized I was trying to ignore the fizz/crackle/hair, it's called a few things. Go to the fender forums and look it up, or search it on yahoo/google.The thing happening with this amp I think is a few things. Fender guitars sound best through it, which is silly if you don't own a fender, and I don't and refuse to get a squire as that body is so played out, I wanted ANYTHING but a strat body, unless I have a grand to pay for an older one, I'm not going to get a rinky dink one, and I would only get one after I got like 5 other dream guitars first.so everyone has different problems with pickup quality and guitar quality. Also, playing into a modeling amp is like playing into a computer, that may be fine for some (younger folks), but to a lot of people I've read the complaints I was trying not to realize, as I didn't feel like having to pay for shipping to return it, BUT I DID!And I am so glad I did. I almost got a peavey vypyr, and I am glad I didn't. This amp, to be fair, is really close to being really cool, but that sound problem, which I read on fender's own forum/website, FENDER ACKNOWLEDGES IT EXISTS, BUT DOES NOTHING TO FIX IT IN FUTURE MODELS!! sorry, but that's some big company b.s.I've been reading of people saying it sounds cold and lifeless and all that and tube this and tube that, and I was like ""what music snobs"" and what have you. But I realized that I'm a music snob! I love the music I listen to more than anything, and feel like the music I create should have a life to it as well. So I returned the mustang 2 and ALMOST got a marshall mg 30 watt, cause I wanted an amp with a clean sound that didn't have that crackle sound, but THANKFULLY I caught myself before that return, as after that, it would have been final.The decision I did make I think will be great for me, as I'd rather start with a good real tone, then get the effects I need. I kept reading reviews of these teenagers that hadn't played for more than a year or two or so saying ""throw away your pedals, you won't need them"" and ""I was going to get pedals, but don't need to now"", that's kind of the danger of these amps, they end up making everyone sound the same! No matter what tweaking I was doing on the mustang, it sounded the same but in a different costume.I think this amp and modeling amps are best for beginning guitarists and I've seen some old timers getting an amp for home use after years, maybe that's for them, but I needed something to record with and practice and get the best, most real tone possible, so that means tube amp.I think if I played this at a GC I wouldn't of gotten it, and I just tried to make myself like it.",Negative
"Could be a fluke, but my unit was defective straight out of the box.  Plugged it into the Macbook Pro, fired up GarageBand and right away it's MIDI connectivity was intermittent. Then it had some stuck notes.  Then it stopped being recognized at all.  It still got power from the USB bus, but no MIDI, no sound.

"I purchased this amp locally and initially, I thought it was pretty cool as it was my first modeling amp; lots of potential for a limitless variety of sounds. This was my first Fender amp as well.The presets were neat and all, but when I played around with some of the ""standard"" models (just the amp model, no effects) just to see how it's clean sound was, the amp just hissed as if I had the volume cranked with a distortion pedal engaged at max. The master volume was at 2 and no effects were turned on... I've never heard a clean channel with so much noise behind it, even when there was no guitar plugged in... All I could hear while playing was the underlying hiss coming through the notes; very distracting and it drove me nuts! This isn't a ground loop issue (my other amps sound just fine at bedroom volumes and beyond), it's clearly a defect with this product. Dirty pre-sets with lots of gain and extra volume sound even worse, again, even when nothing is plugged in and at low master volume. You'd think I was running a few super high gain stomp boxes with a red hot single coil, but NOTHING was plugged in and all I get is staticy-hiss at LOW LEVELS. WTF?The next issue is the weird ""fizz"" sound, that was especially noticeable on the low e. After striking a string, instead of a clean note, there's a weird fizzy digital artifact like sound that ""surrounds"" the note, and fades as the string stops moving. It almost sounds like cymbals crashing on a poorly authored MP3 file at a low bit rate and frequency. Whole chords break down and decay in this fizzy envelope and really makes this thing unplayable.The weird thing is, neither one of these problems arose with head phones plugged in, or when this was connected to my computed via either USB or the line in... but I'm not going to be stuck playing a 100 watt amp through my PC or cans. I got the III instead of the II because of the power behind it and the touted 12"" Celestion speaker.Read the many reviews online or forum posts on many of the guitar/amp related websites (there's a 65 page forum post on the Fender support site that is quite interesting) and you'll find that these amps are having issues. Apparently, the Mustang I and II don't have these issues, and the firmware update did NOTHING to correct my amp. Is this a hardware issue, software issue, speaker issue? There is speculation that the LCD screen (which is not present on the I or II) may be causing problems, but no one seems to know for sure and Fender doesn't seem to care...Definitely try this before you buy it. You may get an amp that doesn't have these problems, you may not notice the sounds or you may not even care; let your ears tell you what sounds good.This amp has a lot of potential for great sounds, and it would have been nice to have faithful modeling of some great vintage amps, but in my opinion, technical issues have made this amp sound like complete garbage. I am disappointed that Fender hasn't yet correct what ever is wrong (some folks claim that Fender reps say that know what is wrong, but I'm not taking that as a fact...), but they have acknowledged that there is ""something"" wrong.Whatever... I took this back after a few days of playing with it, trying to eliminate the junk sounds without success( the built-in noise gate helps a little, but sucks tone) and I picked up a 100 watt Marshall instead. Guess what? The clean channel has ZERO hum or buzz, even when cranked. How about that? Even when I engage a dirt box on one of the dirty channels, there is minimal noise.I'll knock Fender for NOT correcting this issue regardless of what it is and what caused it, but they do have some other nice amps that I'd like to try. But before I buy another Fender amp, I'll take it for a test drive and I suggest you do the same before picking up one of these turds.",Negative

The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work.",Negative
"I purchased this instrument brand new, on an impulse whim due to a managers-choice sale at a local music shop that I simply could not ignore.  It was brand new, unopened, in box.  They allowed me to examine it prior to purchase. In that environment I thought it a nice instrument.However, it can be difficult to properly examine an instrument in a busy store, and that store was VERY busy and noisy.  It's when you get it home and can examine it leisurely in peace and quiet that the details stand out.This is indeed a 6-string ukulele.  It measures a bit over 28"" top to bottom and has the sound of a baritone uke.  I have heard throatier and more mellow instruments in the same price range.  The advantage to this of course is it's 6 string, so if you're a guitar player you can achieve the ukulele sound and portability without learning totally new fingering.... that is of course, until you realize that while it has 6 strings, it is not tuned like a guitar.  It's tuned to ADGCEA rather than EADGBE.  One cannot simply play guitar music on this instrument; all such music has to be transposed or new chord name recognition learned.  Being a total newbie to ukes, this was news to me until I got it home and read the instructions.  So my primary purpose in purchasing this-- to have a small portable guitar, hit a snag.Now that's not totally the end of the thing, because you can be a little inventive and use alternate string sizes to tune this to standard guitar tuning.  It takes a bit of experimentation but it is possible to set this up to standard guitar tuning if one doesn't mind buying a couple of string sets and playing mixup.  So all is not lost there.  It was just an unexpected surprise-- mainly because I didn't research the instrument prior to purchase (it's rare that I impulse buy).So tuning aside we get to the quality of instrument.  That's where the Yamaha really falls short.  This is an oil rather than a lacquer or shellac finish and in several places the oil was still visible and could be wiped away by hand.  There were a couple of glitches in the finish straight out of the box.  That this was a ""rush job"" out of a factory with no finish work at all was blatantly obvious.There are no strap pegs; those will require being added by hand (not difficult, but extra expense and time).The action is of course too high.  That's not unusual-- in truth it's quite common in off-the-shelf stringed instruments and came as no surprise.  But along with the other failures in workmanship it stood out here.However, the thing that bothers me the most:  if I wasn't aware this is a Yamaha Guitalele... I'd think it's was a cheap knock-off child's guitar.  There's not one thing about this instrument that says ""quality""-- which is quite disappointing.  This instrument sells for about $100.  That low cost is obvious.  This is a ""cheap guitar"" in every way.  I can't honestly say it's a toy, but it reeks ""beginner instrument"".  The tuners are as cheap as they come,  the finish is cheap, there is no decoration, no protective edging. The finish is-- unfinished.I bought this solely based on the number of positive reviews here on Amazon-- and I respect those reviews.  People have different tastes and for some folks this has a ""home made"" feel that they will love.  However I've been playing guitar for (mumblety mumble) deca...uh... years and I know the difference between quaint and cheap.  I own two Ovation guitars, a Peavey electric bass, a hand-made violin and an Epiphone electric uke (which is of such higher quality it's not even a contest. And no I'm not hawking Epiphone.  Facts is facts, that's all.  You can read my very-positive review on the Epiphone on Amazon).When I got this  home and took a good look at it, I found no sign of quality or craftsmanship, nothing that said anything more than ""this was made as cheaply and quickly as humanly possible"".  In truth the only positive thing I have to say about it is that it does have a spruce top and the strings are of reasonably decent quality.Other than those two factors, one can find $40-$50 full-size guitars all over Amazon that equal or surpass this instrument in quality.  The only benefit this would offer is its smaller size and ukulele voice-- if someone particularly wants an inexpensive portable guitar tuned like a uke.  Other than its portability, I find no special merit in this and even at its relatively low price... consider it over-priced (or rather, under-made).One must grant it's largely a matter of personal taste and expectation.  But low quality is low quality.(Edit two weeks later:  I just today saw the Cordoba at a local store-- a direct competition to this instrument.  The Cordoba is MUCH nicer.  It's built better, has better sound, and is finished out much more nicely.  Sorry Yamaha, but facts is facts.  Had I seen the Cordoba and Yamaha side by side, I'd have bought and kept the Cordoba.)That's my honest review.  I know some will disagree.  But others know exactly what I mean.  This isn't an expensive instrument so one really can't expect super-fine quality at this price. However-- I paid about the same price for my electric uke and it is superb quality from top to bottom.  As mentioned, the Cordoba is a better instrument and costs the same.Fortunately the local merchant has a satisfaction guarantee and I was able to return it.  I simply cannot recommend this instrument unless there are no better options-- and frankly, there are.",Negative

"I ordered one of these (from MF) and had to send it back because it was damaged and the latches didn't all work.  Even in perfect condition it's still a subpar case.  But the one I got had two ripped corners on the lid, and from those rips it's easy to see that the edge of the lid is just very thin cardboard all around, and the black outside covering provides little protection to keep that cardboard from tearing.  As for the latches (buckles), there are three of them and on the one I had only one worked to keep the case closed.  The other two latched, but they rattled and provided no tension at all to help keep the lid shut.Disregarding those flaws it's still obvious that it's not a good case.  The hinges look like they could fall apart or come off at any moment, the handle is not comfortable to hold, and the whole thing bends in a way that makes you wonder if you would be better off with a gig bag.  It also won't stand evenly on end (if that's important to you).On the positive side it's light, it does fit a Telecaster ok, and the inside is a decent plush lining with a small storage compartment.  But do yourself a favor and spend another $25 and get something better.  I have a Musician's Gear dreadnought case and this doesn't compare to that one at all.",Negative
"Right out of the box, the low E string had a buzz and the intonation was WAY off (fretted E note on the 12th fret too sharp). After the appropriate truss rod adjustments the buzz problem was solved. Next, I proceeded to adjust the intonation. I was able to get the intonation for the A, D, G, B, and high-E strings spot on. However, after bringing the saddle for the low E string as far back as it would go, the fretted E note on the 12th fret was still sharp.I also noticed that the bridge is slightly crooked (the low E string end of the bridge is closer to the neck than the high E string end of the bridge) - the bridge could have started out crooked or it could have shifted due to the high low-E string tension (loose bridge) -- which would definitely contribute to the defective low-E string intonation.I love the Red Burst design of this guitar (it looks absolutely WICKED). Unfortunately, I'm going to have to return it. I'm going to get a Squier Strat instead (with either aMapleorRosewoodneck).---[Update November 15, 2013]I ordered the Squier Strat direct from Amazon 6 weeks ago, but it was placed on backorder. I contacted Customer Service a week ago and was told me they wouldn't get it back in stock until December. Then, to my surprise, the Squier Strat was delivered yesterday! Yay!! :D The happiness!!I was able to get the Squier perfectly intonated. It's Red Burst like the Legacy (Fender calls it Antique Burst). It's a beautful guitar and and I'm loving it!",Negative

"Well... it's not really too expensive, but it give you basically the same sound no matter how you set it.  Even the crunch button is just a louder sound?  Not a very good value unless you try it out first and this is exactly the sound you're looking for.  Guess that's why it's so cheap.",Negative

"DOWNGRADE TO 1-O STAR AFTER RETURNING IT BACK TO BROOKMAYS, THE SELLER:I am really disappointed by the seller, BrookMays', ignorant responses to my return of the defective Cherbub Guitar Pickup, which picks up unwanted noise by the wire's own movements and the high frequency of feedback that other pickup won't have the same issue.  After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, ""it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.""  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description ""regardless the surrounding noises.""  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description. Good Luck then!",Negative
This is more of a toy than a good pickup. It functions but doesn't sound great. What did I want for this price anyway?,Negative
"First we have to realize this is not a $200 pickup or even a $50 pickup.  It's less than ten bucks.It has a specially-designed clamp that is good for attaching it to the sound hole of a guitar.  As such it is not going to work for an instrument without a considerable-size sound hole.  It also will tend to get in the way of those who play directly over the sound hole, as it is quite easy to hit and will pick up any contact noise.It is more sensitive than cheaper competitor devices.  Unless you run it directly into the amp within a distance of 8 ft you are also going to need a 1/4"" to 1/4"" coupler (to allow it to connect to an extension guitar cord).  You will need such extension as this tends to have significant feedback issues if the amp is too close or facing the guitar.It is a passive pickup, so you will need either an amp with a passive-specific input or a preamp mixer or other preamp device. If you don't have a preamp system, this will do you no good.So because of the limitations I rate it as above.  For what it does though-- providing a passive pickup that can be quickly switched out between instruments, it does okay.  I believe there are better pickup concepts out there for about the same amount of money, including adhesive-disk mikes.  I would prefer to permanently mount a pickup of some kind and there are many low-cost pickups out there to choose from.  But this is a slightly different concept (removable) that for the price is worth checking in to.",Negative
"I bought this to use on my Fender P-bass. It is not reliable for me, sometimes it works and sometimes it can't find the low note correctly. I'm still using my Roland stomp box tuner. Glad this was inexpensive, it was not worth the hassle to return, i gave it away.",Negative
"I am a long-time musician with lots of experience with tuners and stringed instruments ... wanted to like this ... but ...First the positives:- Looks great- nice, easy to read display- the screen pivots in almost every direction to suit your needs- the clip seems sturdy- tuner is compact- nice priceNow the significant disappointment:- inaccurateThe settings were on A-440 but every time I tuned an acoustic instrument with this thing, the tuning was sharp ... I tested this not only by ear but against other tuners ... very disappointing ... I have used the old Planet Waves tuners for years and had settled on them as the best choice for the price; however, since D'Addario now owns Planet Waves products, they have discontinued the tuner I like and only offer the NS Mini Tuner (it has its place I guess, but I much prefer the larger one ... too bad they made this decision IMO) ...I haven't settled on my new tuner of choice yet so for now I will keep using my old Planet Waves models ...Bottom line, no matter how nice the Snark is in many ways, the primary function is to help the musician tune accurately, not only string to string but to a standard A-440 ... having failed that requirement, it is useless for me, especially in a band situation ...",Negative
"I own the SN-8, which btw, is the best tuner I've ever used. I bought this bc it said it was made specifically for bass frequencies & violin. So I wanted to use this w my acoustic bass and violin. I was also intrigued by the &#34;tighter&#34; tuning aspect of the bars on this. Let me tell you, if it worked, the bars may have been a cool feature, but when you are fine-tuning an A string and it tells you you are on E (when you know you are on A bc the other tuners all say A, and it matches the piano), then there is a problem. I could not find any way to re-calibrate the thing, so it looks like it's just defective. The one I received was completely useless.I am amazed at the great SN-8...I am disappointed in this thing. I must have just received a dud (I hope, since these usually get good reviews), but I will be returning this since it absolutely does not work correctly. On the flip side, I will be getting another SN-8 in it's place, since I know those are great tuners & I love the one I already have.",Negative
"There is almost no difference between this and the Snark SN-1, and by that I mean the design flaws. You have to constantly adjust the neck to get a reading, and they eat batteries like crazy. The Snark SN-8 is far superior.",Negative
"Can't believe they are still selling these things at full price with the old 30 pin connector.  I have lots of pads but none still have the old style connector.  This is now a boat anchor.  To buy a 3 meter cable from them, they charge $40 for the cable, $15 to ship it and then tax.  The extortion here is almost Monster cable like.  These folks should be embarassed.",Negative
"This gadget works fine to connect an electric guitar to an iPad or iPhone or a computer, but the particular one I received has a defective input socket for a 1/4 inch audio plug.  It doesn't snap in place.  Just sits there waiting to let the plug slide out.  That makes it fairly useless.  I may have simply gotten a defective one.",Negative
"What was thought to be a DOA model, ended up being a mistake on my behalf.

It is bigger than I had imaginedIt's almost the length of an iPhone. Feels nice, and is very light. The cords aren't very long.",Negative
"The velcro itself is insanely amazing. Its so amazing that its stronger than the adhesive backing. If you have an alternative means to adhere this velcro to its surface with a strength stronger than 10 men, then by all means, use this stuff. In the end, you just can't make velcro this strong for use with a pedal board. Once together, it raises the height of the pedal very uncomfortably. I cannot think of a practical application for this velcro.",Negative
"I tried this in front, in the middle, and at the end of an effects chain, as well as by itself, plugged into the effects loop of my Mesa Boogie Mark V amplifier.  Whenever it is in the path, as soon as I engage my effects loop, the signal level drops considerably.  It did not matter whether the pedal was on or not.  The chorus effect is good, but I don't want my volume to drop every time I turn on my effects loop.  I have the loop balanced with all of the other pedals that I use, so I can't raise the send any more.",Negative

"This cable was very affordable, but you get what you pay for. It sounded brilliant while it wasn't broken, for about the 4 hours of runtime. It works if it isn't abused at all, but if you abuse it in any way at all, your out an XLR cable. I do not recommend this product at all for heavy usage.",Negative
Well... its a stand..  its super cheap and i don't mean the price.  the edges are sharp and the piece that holds the neck of the guitars is leaning too far back.. i stuck some cardboard under the rear post to help keep that back brace more up right and no leaning back.  its going to work but i bumped the bottom with my bare feet and it cut me pretty well.  Instructions were ok..  came with more parts than what were required... all holes filled and i have  of of each part extra.. the guitars do not sit very well in this stand... i will use it until i can find a better one.. it will get replaced.. i really should send this POS back to Amazon.  the concept is great but the execution of it sucks. it folds down but not sure i would use this as a portable stand..  there are better options out there for something portable.  this stand is worth 10.00 tops... if i had it to do all over i would save my money.,Negative
This stand is ok for light home use. I would not recommend this thing for gigging or travel. Very cheaply made but does the job. Guitars do not rest naturally in a sweet spot. You must set a guitar down in the correct position or it will lay a bit sideways and jar other guitars on  the rack. Avoid if you can spend more.,Negative
"I really like Epiphone products. They are well-made, easy to play guitars. I also purchased an Ep Les Paul Special 2 Ebony from Amazon a while back. But, I received this Uke defective. I expected when I plugged it in it would play through an amplifier but I couldn't here anything at all. Totally dead. There are no volume controls but it was like the volume was turned all the way down. I'm disappointed because I expect Gibson to test each guitar before it leaves the factory. I actually bought this guitar for a friend and was very embarrassed when I got over to his house and it didn't work in front of him. I just requested a return/exchange from Amazon. If the next one works ok I may buy a second one for me. I seem to have bad luck with electric-acoustic guitars when purchased through Amazon. I had to send back my Dean 12 string elec-acoust to Amazon too because of an intermittent sound problem.  I do want to state that this is a beautiful Uke with nice feeling nylon strings, fine wood high polished surface, high quality tuners and plays loud acoustically.  The actual guitar looks even BETTER in person than in the picture. If this Uke was working 100% I would have given it a 4 or 5.",Negative
"I sometimes see reviews as redundant and unnecessary and I see a lot of positive reviews for this guitar strap, but I don't know why. Maybe other people don't really care what kind of strap they have or maybe they just have never had a good strap before. It wasn't too hard to get on and only took a couple of seconds, but once I got it on it was stiff and felt odd. It was very uncomfortable around my neck and I took it off my guitar in a matter of matters. I would honestly recommend spending a few extra dollars on a more expensive and more comfortable strap. Unless you're just going for something that is inexpensive, does the job, and isn't designed for comfort.",Negative
"I ordered 1 just to try it since it was so cheap, the first one arrived in non working condition, wires inside werent even soldered, so i ordered a replacement, plugged it in and it didnt work either, the second wasnt soldered either.I know its cheap, but i expected it to at least work, do not buy",Negative
"It was almost obvious this product would come from china but even worse when it ships from china.  Any thing i have bought that was shipped directly from china has been much lower quality than anything retailers are even willing to sell.  If you can wait a month for delivery or longer, if you dont mind your guitar falling off the wall when the chinese quality lives up to its reputation then order up.  If you have over a $500 guitar be wise and buy an expensive one unfortunately they will most likely be made in china too. I have decided to build my own",Negative
"It did not perform. Looks cool, but thats it. Very large and inconvenient. Would not recommend this because I would not recommend the blue yeti.",Negative
This is shown on an electric guitar and it would probably be great there. I play acoustic guitars and the headstocks all angle back it has to attach at the top then it is hard to see the screen. It worked but I don't use it anymore.,Negative
"Compared to the SnarkSnark SN-1 Tunertuners, I really like the low profile / leave it on the instrument design of this tuner. The Snark goose neck is easily broken, and hard to keep safe in a gig bag. This works much better in that regard. This one is fairly bright and easy to see in all lighting conditions. It mounts very positively and seems to sense all strings fine.  Tuning accuracy? Hard to say- it just indicates high / low / on pitch, really. I prefer the more precise and wider scale +/1 readout of the Snark. They are much more precise- nearly good enough to intonate an instrument. But this is probably good enough for most, just to get dialed in at the rehearsal or gig.The negatives, and why I can't recommend it are as follows. The battery cover on mine fits very loosely. I worry the battery will fall out very easily. I may end up gluing it in place. It isn't immediately obvious where the battery goes or how to open it, and there's no indicator which way the battery goes in (+ is up I think).  The second fault is that once it is on your headstock the string note letters display perpendicular to the user- that's right, sideways.  On a bass, I don't really need it to tell me which string I'm plucking or tuning, but I still find myself craning my neck sideways to read it. It wouldn't be so hard to read either if the letters weren't so highly stylized, but then turn it on its side, and it is just unreadable - for me, anyhow. I just can't for the life of me work out why they designed it this way.",Negative
"The device itself is difficult to read in bright light.My first one arrived not working at all.The second one arrived with a low battery. What? After three days the battery goes out.I would have returned it, but lost it because it doesn't adhere to the headstock very well. You've been warned.",Negative
"I don't know who owns the rights to this wonderful production, but considering all the other Rankin/Bass goodies available on DVD, why has Mouse On The Mayflower been ignored for release? It's ludacris! Release it!! For heaven's sake!! This production deserves at least the same repect that was given to lesser productions like ""Rudoloph's Shiny New Year"" or ""The Little Drummer Boy, Book II"", which were not half as good as Mouse On The Mayflower"". Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did. I loved the songs, and I'd listen to the tapes I made and play the visuals over and over in my head. God it was great being a kid! C'Mon Rankin/Bass! Bring this one back on DVD! It's a classic!",Positive
"Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.",Positive
"This is a Thanksgiving tale that begins with the ship Mayflower being caught up in a big storm. A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include ""Elbow Room"" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called ""When He Looks at Me"", a love song between John and Priscilla called ""Time Stands Still"" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  ""This Land was Meant to be Free"", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, ""Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer"". After Rudolph their next holiday special was ""Cricket on the Hearth"" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.",Positive
"This is the BEST THANKSGIVING special around...and I am not just saying that because I am the RANKIN/BASS Historian.  The sound on this VHS is magnificent and it should be on DVD!  I have the original GAS LP Soundtrack on CD.  MAURY LAWS and JULES BASS did a wonderful job with the score.  ELBOW ROOM, sung by TENN.

"It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson",Positive

"I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket. Woodstock 99' wasan awesome event with alot of great new music and a wholenew generation of people.It's ok to remember the firstwoodstock but now there will be more and better woodstock'sin the future.",Positive
"As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews. It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.",Positive
"I dock this DVD one star only because I wanted it to be longer. Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great. The DVD includes &quot;supplemental material,&quot; but is is of  little consequence. This is a disc you buy for the music.",Positive
"Im surprised that people have let their moral stand on the excesses of the event,mar their review of this disc.While I sympathise with those affected,I will stick to reviewing this disc,which is what this forum is for.The Production values : Are top notch.I have bought some DVDs recorded in 2006,which do not look or sound as good as this one.The producers of this release knew their job well.The Music and performances : Im a metalhead and I thought there would be barely 3-4 songs on this disc that I would like.Well barring 3-4 songs ( out of 29 ),I loved EVERY performance on this disc.The disc really captures the environment of the gig and brings it into your room.Its fun to watch the crowd go crazy during KORN and Metallica's set.There are some weak moments tho',but they can be easily overlooked.Im surprised that some killer acts like Godsmack,which made it to the audio CD did not make it to the DVD - thats disappointing.The Extras - There's lots of em'.All the songs are interspresed with a walk around the Woodstock ground,so you get a good idea of what was happening around the place over the 3 days.So that makes it about 1 hours worth of bonus material,apart from band interview snippets and some other backstage stuff.All in all,if you are a fan of great live music and grand concerts,this disc is an awesome deal.BUY IT !",Positive
"For those of you guitar music lovers, (mostly men, I guess), this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.",Positive
JOE AND STEVE PLAY ALMOST THE SAME. Eric has so much talent. I only wish I could hear more Eric Johnson!,Positive
"Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.",Positive
G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!,Positive
"What an excellent video! Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In  conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The  picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an  impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection.",Positive
"Honestly, all individuals are born different from the other. In G3's situation the 3 of them have their own distinctive feeling & style in playing that would obviously lift you up from your seats and scream out loud the word ""Yeah"". That is why I would not and could not classify who is ranking no.1, 2, or 3 among them. Unless, if your head is inflated with fowl air then approach me and I'm 100% willing to deflate your pathetic medical case and grant you guarantees of cure comprise of ""Love & Respect"". Buy this Dvd because your in for a special treat.",Positive
"This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani, Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs, and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan, or for anyone who loves guitar music. If I could give it a 10 stars, I'd give 10.",Positive
"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects, this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better.",Positive
"So lets start of by saying I could only see Satch live in Buenos Aires Argentina, and I was like there is such a difference between live and studio that its just amazing. My favorite artist here is Steve, so what can I say bout this guys that hasn't been said.  Firstly, the song selection from these artists isn't all that great, think Steve could have chosen some better songs from the Passion and Warfare album.  Two of these songs come from that album, although I would have loved to listen ANIMAL and EROTIC NIGHTMARES which are two of Vai's greatest songs for my taste.  This DVD is kind of short, they could have included one more song for each artist.  It's about 75 minutes long. Though regarding quality its very good, I definately was left wanting more.  Anyway the price is excellent so I suggest you buy it anyway, a must own DVD for any fan.  Worth it for the price!!! is my final comment.",Positive
"I love to listen to any album with good guitar playing,except for classical.It's not that it isn't good,I just don't like it.I checked out the CD and decided that it would be more fun to watch on DVD.Here is my review of each guitarist on here:Joe Satriani starts off the show.He is the guitarist I was most familiar with before buying the CD and DVD.He plays the songs ""Cool No.9"",""Flying in a Blue Dream,""and ""Summer Song"".The third one is my favorite.He is my all time favorite guitarist(Vai is second).Eric Johnson is next.He is the guitarist I was least familiar with.He is the most melodic guitarist here.On here,he plays the songs ""Intro Song,Manhattan,and ""SRV"".On the CD,he plays ""Zap"",""Manhattan"",and ""Camel's Night Out"".Manhattan is my favorite on both.I like it because it sounds jazzy.Steve Vai closes this show.He is probably my second  favorite guitarist on here.He is definitely the most of a showman.Plus he has ""The Incredible"" Mike Keneally on guitar and keyboards.He plays the songs ""Answers"",""For The Love of God"",and ""Attitude Song"".In ""Attitude Song"",him and Mike Keneally duel with each other,and Keneally is just as fast.Last becomes the best moment of all.All 3 ""G's"" jam together!They play the Freddie King/Jeff Beck classic ""Going Down"",the Frank Zappa classic ""My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama"",and a nine minute blues workout on the Jimi Hendrix classic ""Red House"".The second is my favorite.Joe sings the first song,Steve and Keneally sing the second,and Eric sings the last.None of them can really sing.I can't wait to go to G3 '03 with Yngwie Malmsteen instead of Eric Johnson.P.S.I went there.It was awesome,but this concert was better.I missed Eric Johnson.Yngwie's licks sounded mostly the same,and the three man jams were EXTREMELY loud.",Positive
"Anyone that enjoys watching a virtuoso play will enjoy this DVD. There are a few minor production flubs, and I wish they would have included at least one of Johnson's more popular songs. Picture and sound are very good. These guys are at the very top of the list of guitar players and all 3 together is breathtaking.",Positive
"Three extremely talented and unique guitarists come together for one of the best concerts I've ever seen! Viewing this made me feel like I was on the front row! And the most amazing thing (besides the music) is that sells for just 10 bucks! Absolutely the wisest 10 bucks I've ever spent! I give it 15 stars!Some may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert. G-3 LIVE IN CONCERT is a 3 song live playing of each artist and then they all jam together at the end in complete rapport and friendship. You can tell they all respect each other alot. The running time is 75 minutes of &quot;glued to your seat&quot; entertainment! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!Here are the songs in order: SATRIANI plays 1) Cool No9 2) Flying In A Blue Dream and 3) Summer Sky. The second is my favorite. JOHNSON plays second. His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite.  VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song. Again the second song is my favorite.&quot;THE JAM SONGS&quot; (FEATURING ALL 3 G-3'S) are: 1) Going Down 2) My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama and 3) Red House (in honor of the late, great Jimi Hendrix.) The third song is my favorite.I highly and whole-heartedly recommend this videotape--incredible  sound, very entertaining, diverse, and fun to view. You will not be disappointed; trust me! BUY THIS NOW! DON'T MISS IT! There isn't a single boring moment or bad song; these guys ROCK! It will make you a fan of all three if you aren't already!",Positive
"This is some of the best guitar work you will ever see on one stage in one concert, you will not regret this disc.",Positive
"After reading some of the other reviews I really don't have much more to add.  However in my opinion it's as good as the other's have said and then some.  I own three of these 3G concert versions, and this is my favorite because of the jam at the end with all three.  It's too bad they didn't make that a tridition with all three, but the other two are damn good and well worth purchasing on their own merit....A good collection to own if you're in to exteremly hot guitar licks....",Positive
The darkness and romantic elements of Mr. Buckley's stories seem to lead quite fittingly to him drowning at a young age in the mythic Mississippi river. This is a great show from an exceptional talent. Mr. Buckley  performs like a man possessed.I had to take back a copy of this DVD  because of digital noise aroung Lilac Wine. But aside from the technical  flaw this is a fantastic DVD.,Positive
"I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.",Positive
"&quot;Compelling&quot; is the best word to describe this concert dvd.  Filmed with a minimum of cameras, edits, production  - allowing the viewer to focus on the artist and his music -  the way it should be.  Combine that with Buckley's power, passion, presence, terrific band, great sound mix and magnificent songs makes this a true gift to Buckley fans. Not ever seeing Jeff Buckley live has always been a big disappointment for me - this dvd fills that void.",Positive
This is a GREAT DVD.  He truly was an amazing artist.  This show covers what a typical show was like.I got to see Jeff twice on his 1995 tour.  Both performances were in the same day...an acoustic set at a local record store and live.  I had only heard &quot;So Real&quot; and wanted to see him play.  I went to the acoustic show and was amazed and blown away.  I had to see him that night.  I told friends the next week on what a great show it was. A few people borrowed my copy of Grace and they had to go out and buy their own cd.,Positive
"Any true fan of Jeff Buckley will obviously have Grace, a truely remarkable album by one of the most awsome, talented, and passionate songwriters/singers ever to ""grace"" this planet!! And if you are that fan, then you will want to have this concert in your possesion. Just to see Jeff perform, along with his talented band, you see his ability expressed in his playing, and his vocal range. It is all just so great to be able to see this talent in person.Yes, the production may be somewhat raw and less than perfect,however,  Jeff is just that.....perfect. I don't care about the sound production being less than perfect, but seeing Jeff play live and in concert, is just a thrill. We fans have a limited selection of CD's that Jeff has performed, so having this DVD available is a must BUY for anyone who claims to be a Jeff Buckley die hard fan.JLMankin",Positive
"I would be satisfied only with the Eletronic Press Kit, or I would be satisfied only with the 2 acoustic songs, or I would be just satisfied with the concert. Now imagine having all together ! This DVD deserves 5 stars !  You don't need to be a fan to become one after watching this amazing video  !",Positive
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed a stellar concert, but there are two problems that plague it:1. Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you're a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn't that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a 'Discography' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he's ever worked on (such as 'Sketches' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn't diminished in its' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today. Like I said, its not great, but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music. Three Stars for the DVD. I'm rounding the rating out to a total of four Stars.",Positive
"To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between  songs, the calls from the crowd.  The DVD is excellent, two seperate sound  mixes, regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix.  Two  bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny.",Positive
"Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It's  good, get it.",Positive
"I was a big Jeff Buckley fan before Grace was released, the Live at Sine' EP CD was so great i was primed and ready when Grace hit the shelves. I turned at least several friends on to Jeff and for a while felt I was the only one who had even heard of him. When Last Goodbye hit the radio I was ecstatic. After all this i passed up at least 2 opportunities to see him live during his tours in 1995 and 1996.  This DVD made me regret those decisions even more. As has been stated, THIS IS THE WAY A CONCERT DVD SHOULD BE.  Live in Chicago blew me away. I thought I knew what to expect. I knew it would be a good concert. I bought the Mystery White Boy CD that was recently released, and thought THAT was an eye opener. This DVD leaves the CD WAY behind.  All i can say is if you never saw Jeff in concert, you owe it to yourself to experience something like this. He was not a &quot;star&quot; or an &quot;icon&quot;. Jeff Buckley was a life. So Real.",Positive
"Jeff Buckley left this planet too early, and what remains of his work still lovingly haunts and mesmerizes fans. &quot;Live In Chicago&quot; is priceless, capturing the essence of Buckley's live shows.Anyone who was fortunate enough to catch a Buckley show while he was alive will tell you that it is an unbelievable experience. This video captures the show in it's entirety, including Buckley's between-song humor.Highlights? Impossible to narrow down. Really. The bonus features on this disc are great collector's pieces - 2 rare acoustic performances from a cable access show, and an electronic press kit are included.No extra hype here - no fluff. Just a straight-up Buckley show in all it's beauty, untouched and as real as it gets. If you are a Buckley fan, this should be number one on your wish list.",Positive
"I have been waiting anxiously for this DVD to come out for a very long time, and was not let down by it at all.  From the amazing full concert footage, to the haunting Grace Electronic Press Kit, this DVD is a must  have for all Buckley fans.  We get to see a glimpse of Jeff in an intimate  club setting and it's really nice to have captured that moment and to be  able to go back to it, and be amazed over and over.  It is truly a sad and  beautiful thing all at once.  I urge all music lovers to give Jeff Buckley  a listen, and try not to be impressed.  The only thing that I would have  also included, would have been all of Jeff's videos.  Other than that, this  is perfect.  Thanks Mary, for leaving the light on.",Positive
"Wow, this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan, and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert, even if you dont know Jeff, is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album, and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great, try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!",Positive
"Live in Chicago is an excellent release for Jeff Buckley fans who never got to see Buckley in concert. Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances. There are spurts of humor, improvised lyrics, and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience. This isn't a particularly important concert; it isn't his first nor his last. However, it's being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be. One word describes it: amazing. The extra features are just as good. There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous. It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience's reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, ""I love you too."" This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get, the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley, he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music.",Positive
"Here is your only chance to see the great talent of Jeff Buckley, live and in person.  Sadly, he lost his life in a swimming accident, and the world will be diminished, musically, by this tragedy.  However, some of his finest work is captured here.  This concert gives the viewer a chance to see a young talent ply his skills with pure artistry. His guitar is captivating, and his voice is haunting.  Give yourself a musical treat, and pick this DVD up.  The only reason I gave it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of a digital flaw in the song Lilac Wine.  The program stalls in this song.  I checked on more than one DVD player, and they both manifested the same pause.  Other than that... a great buy!",Positive
"Where to start? I'm sure most of you know the Jeff Buckley story. In short, Buckley was an amazing singer and musician who only had the opportunity to release one full-length album before his life was taken away. But fans, followers, and mourners rejoice - Live In Chicago captures him at his peak, and shines like a beacon of light into our darkened souls. Yes, that's right - this concert is magical, transcendent, and just absolutely gorgeous.Jeff Buckley had a penchant for writing amazing songs, and they are on display full-force here. It is just magical to hear (and see!) him sing these songs that I thought were inhuman and impossible to sing outside of the recording studio. The ethereal beauty of &quot;Hallelujah&quot; had the live crowd, as well as me, sitting in a stunned silence at the perfectness they were witnessing. But this magnificent display is somehow outshined by some of Buckley's other songs.The song &quot;Grace&quot; stands as a milestone in my music listening experience. Jeff's voice is just perfectly original and absolutely BEYOND COMPREHENSION. I really can't describe it, and I literally sat in awe for minutes after seeing this. Let's make this simple on you (and me, since I honestly cannot describe this up to the standards it deserves) - if you are a Jeff Buckley, fan, this is a no-braier: Buy it now. If you are a singer, and want to see and hear something amazing, definitely buy this. If you simply want to hear the most amazing thing ever, buy this. Jeff Buckley may be gone from Earth, but his music, spirit, and beauty will live on forever with this DVD.",Positive
"This DVD of Mozart's Don Giovanni is a really good one by my standards. The top-notch cast, brilliant scenery and costumes, and wonderful orchestra make this one of my favorite Don's ever. I personally don't like Herbert von Karajan, but I learned to tolerate him. Samuel Ramey as the vile Don was a great casting decision. He blends vivacity and vileness it one very impressive package. Anna Tomowa-Sintow is a brilliant Donna Anna. Her high notes are absolutely stunning and sings with a firm foundation. The Don Ottavio of Gosta Winbergh is stunning, but he lacked something. Nevertheless he was very pleasing. The Commendatore of Paata Burchuladze is good for all that he's in. Now for the best: Julia Varady as Donna Elvira. I think she was Karajan's substitute for Agnes Baltsa but Varady surpasses her in EVERY way. She is velvety-voiced and gives light to the aguishly played Elvira. The Leoporello of Ferrucio Furlanetto is very pleasing. Kathleen Battle as Zerlina was also a good casting call. Alexander Malta as Masetto is a little guff now and then but gives a solid performance. A good DVD for an expert or a beginner.",Positive
"As each of the reviewers has been saying, this is a magnificent opera.  I really can't imagine Don Giovanni being performed any better.  Aside from the women's costumes, the entire production is stunning in every way.  You must buy it.BUT my disc, at least, does not show subtitles (in any language) on the second side of the single disc.  That's a serious flaw that SONY must rectify.",Positive
"Being somewhat new to opera, my taste is still developing. This review isn't for the seasoned experts, it's for the person who wants to explore opera but needs recommendations.So, I like a traditional staging. I don't want some S&M; interpretation or any other modernizations. I once saw the Shakespearean play Henry V ""modernized"" and it was an insult to the writer---I don't want to see things too minimal. I hate these new spartan sets with no staging.This performance delivers. The singing is excellent. All around really good singing. Von Karajan delivers---he brings a snap to every performance that Levine lacks.If you're wading through reviews and trying to decide if you want to try opera, here you go. It's a great investment. You will watch it repeatedly and you will enjoy it. It's well done, fun, great music, great costumes and sets.I highly recommend to any beginners. Also, this is a story that is easy and fun to follow. You don't need a background in Norse mythology, Schopenhauer or 16th century Venetian politics.",Positive
"This is a fine film record of Mozart's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s. It is a nicely paced, well-staged production with some excellent singing.  Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well.  The staging is pretty much traditional.  I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.  It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have.",Positive
"Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of ""Don Giovanni.""  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.",Positive
"Some faults on this DVD: you need to change the sides at the end of each act; it doesn't comes with a booklet about the production (only advertisings - Karajan, Sony, etc.); the picture quality is sometimes  a little dark, with low definition, and the sound is only good. Otherwise, is a very good ""Don Giovanni"" to have.Von Karajan's conducting may be controversial: in some parts, like in the recitativo before ""Mi tradi quel'alma ingrata"", is very slow. But this is a question of taste:  in these times of ""authentic fast tempi"", some more ""relaxed"" conducting may be good for tired ears. And in moments that requires fast tempi, they are there, like in the supper.And we have outstanding singers here: the very ""macho"" Don of Ramey is almost perfect. He can be a seductor with the ladies, a sadic ""padrone""to Leporello, and a men full of fear in his final appointment with the Commendatore (the great bass Burchuladze). The role of Leporello is in charge of Ferrucio Furlanetto - good voice, very good acting. Windbergh is Ottavio: his voice can be excessively ""lyric"" for this role (more a Ferrando than an Ottavio), but he sounds good at all. Malta seems a little old for a Masetto, but sings well. The ladies are all very nice: a great Anna in Tomowa-Sintow, a outstanding Elvira in Varady (the portrait of a insane woman), a charming Zerlina in Battle.The orchestra is the Wiener Philharmoniker - that's enough to say. The scenarios are sometimes very dark, but not necessarily unclear.If you love this opera,  this is a good choice: a very good cast (there are not a single bad or misscasted singer here); a good conducting (here, von Karajan is controversial in some tempi, but a master in orchestral balance and texture); outstanding orchestra and chorus; at last, a terrific statue scene.Good picture and sound quality. And a nice price.",Positive
"This version of Giovanni is extremely impressive and has much fine music to offer.  I  recommend it whole-heartedly for the great moments of lush, wonderful sound it delivers. Varady, Tomowa-Sintow, Ramey, Battle are well-cast and all perform admirably.  I certainly found myself breathless at several places hearing this Divinely inspired score so wonderfully sung.  But you should be warned, this production takes itself mighty seriously.  There are places where you may even find yourself a little bored.  Despite a fabulous comic turn by Ferlinetto as Leporello, this production is a bit leaden. The Met version with Ramey and Battle had a better balance of comedy and drama in my opinion and was better-acted. When Giovanni was carried off to Hell at the end, it came as a genuine surprise and the subtlety  of the drama's structure seemed much more ingenious that way.  But even if that version were available. you would probably want this one in your collection as well  If you are in the mood for some gorgeous Mozart music, this performance just might blow you away",Positive
"This DVD (or VHS) is outstanding and gives you an idea, how profound, superb and professional maestro Karajan is. This performane is taped in 80th, but still, the power and magic of my favourite conductor can be clearly seen. He is demanding, he is precise and unbelievable. First of all he is responsible for the staging of this &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and one can see that the staging is superb. Nothing has espaced through Karajan's attention, every single detail is so correct. And watch to the scene when commendatore comes to Don Giovanni's house, the idea of taking Don Giovanni with him to the stars is new (we all know that Don Giovanni is going to burn in the hell, so he is not supposed to go up to the sky, he must go down to the hell), but really breathtaking, I wish I attended this performance live to see how it looks in the opera-house.What about performers? They are outstanding. Samuel Ramey is splendid, perfect Don Giovanni, Furlanetto is terrific Leporello and of course Paata Burchuladze's voice is so great, I saw him singing Leporello, he was unbelievable, here he sings Commendatore and he is really great.This is must have &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, you can not find &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; of the same level.",Positive
"I have been familiar with Herbert von Karajan and the singers on this DVD for a long time before finally seeing them in action, and I must say, not one of them failed to impress, and each one of them is just as amazing as I had always expected.  This is absolutely one of the greatest productions of Don Giovanni, which just happens to be my favorite opera, in this whole world.  Von Karajan seems to be still at the peak of his power with the baton, and I just cannot say enough great things about the cast, especially Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Samuel Ramey, Julia Varady, and Kathleen Battle. This is a must-have in the collection of any opera/Don Giovanni lover!",Positive
"This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars.",Positive
"I bought this version even though I own another,because Kathleen Battle was in it. I wasn't disappointed. It is the best copy of Giovanni available. I enjoyed all the characters because they were so lively and not dull as in my other version. I highly recommend it. Buy it here online today.",Positive
"I think I own 10 dvd's of Don Giovanni, and the Von Karajan is the standard against which all Don's are measured.  His tempo is pefect...others take it either too fast or too slow...Ramey is perfect as the Don....what a singer this guy is....a perfect singer of Mozart and Rossini.................a national treasure for sure.  His Assur in Semeriamide is an outstanding role also.....Highly recommended.",Positive
"This is a wonderful DVD, having all the best of ingredients that blend together to make a near perfect Don G.Herbert V. Karajan has done a magnificent job with the orchestrated music and the performers are top notch (acting as well as singing). I found the setting perfectly suited to the style and mood of this great work: dark, seductive and secretive. The camera angles are well placed and the audio is superb.Samuel Ramey is a perfect Don G. Unrelenting in his persuit of the fairer sex and unrepentant as well: great voice and obviously enjoys his role as the world's number one philanderer.Julia Varady is the frequently scorned and forever forgiving damsel. Her non singing part in Leporello's ""Madamina"" is delightful to watch.Kathleen Battle plays a coquettish Zerlina and her arias and the duet with Ramey are magnificent to behold.My favorite performance however, is by Ferruccio Fulanetto as the roguish Leporello; playing the role of a scoundrel who knows he should know better but is having too much fun to stop.One final point: I liked the menu on this DVD. Giving you the option to play the entire concert or go to a particular scene. Also the choice of language for the subtitles was nice as well: although I speak English only, I find that once you get used a particular opera, it really is nice to follow along the voices in the recorded language, in this case Italian. I must admit that my favorite opera language is Italian.The true measure of pleasure an opera gives me is how often I listen to my favorite sections and it comes as no surprise that I play several sections very often.  It seems every time I observe something  new.If you were considering getting Don Giovanni I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this DVD. You will not be disappointed.",Positive
excellent cast in this most delightful of Mozart operas- conducted by karajan and with feruccio furlanetti (leporello) as don giovanni's (samuel ramey) counterpoint,Positive
"From the opening notes of the opera to the very end, this recording of Don Giovanni will captivate you.  On top of the excellent orchestral support from the Wiener Philharmoniker and Herbert von Karajan, there is a very strong cast of characters.  My personal favorite is Leporello, sung by Ferruccio Fulanetto.  His voice is strong, deep, and resonant.  All of the characters are not just singing but act well to make the DVD interesting to watch.  Samuel Ramey is excellent in the role of Don Giovanni.  He makes you sickened by the character and in the end when Don Giovanni is pulled down into hell, you feel like the the bad guy finally got what he was deserving.  In summary, the plot is captivating.  The performance truly is first rate with great performances by Kathleen Battle as Zerlina, Donna Anna, sung by Anna Tomawa-Sintow, and Donna Elvira, sung by Julia Varady.  Another great highlight is the trio sung by Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Don Ottavio.  Pure magic results when these three sing about bringing down the Don.  This DVD is a must for anyone that is a fan of the operas of Mozart and a great place to start for someone looking into opera.  Great sound and video too!",Positive
"This is the best Don Giovanni I've ever seen. Samuel Ramey is commanding in the lead. Costumes and staging are wonderful. Furlanetta is a great Leporello and has gone on to play this role for years all over the world. I think Varady is an especially strong Elvira and the ending is, by far, the best Giovanni ending of all time. Of course, Von Karajan's conducting is perfect.",Positive
"At about 10 mos. my younger daughter started taking interest in this video. The muppets are interspersed with live-action clips of kids w. babies (as well s farm animals &amp; dogs) which really grabs her attention. Elmo himself is very bright and animated, which attracts the attention of kids younger than the recommended ages (3-6). I would note that my almost-5-y.o. was bored by this after one or two viewings, but is more than happy to explain to her younger sibling what is going on in the video.I noticed that the other Sesame Street videos we have do not interest my toddler like this Elmo's World video does. It seems less tedious and faster paced with more emphasis on visuals than the other Sesame Street videos do. I would recmmend this one as a nice 'first' introduction to Sesame Street beginning in the toddler years. It dosen't bother with counting and the alphabet like more 'grown up' Sesame Street, but rather focuses on this that are really facinating for really little ones like babies (like themselves!) and animals.Highly recommend - and sooner rather than later.",Positive
"this one is great to throw in the mini van for short trips because the segments are short, so you don't have to wait until the end of the DVD to get out of the car (for those with DVDs in their car/van/truck) Basically it is the same Elmo snippets you see on Sesame Street.",Positive
"We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies, dogs, and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well. And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies, dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids.",Positive
My 18-month-old loves this tape! I like that it is an hour long and keeps her occupied the entire time! There are three Elmo's World episodes: Playing with babies. Second are the dogs. The final episode examines life on the farm and daily chores done there. It is a fun tape with lots of baby animals to look at. Nothig like babies animals to capture the attention of an active toddler! If this tape were only on DVD- it would be perfect.,Positive
"Elmo's World is all right but not my favorite part of Sesame Street. My son likes this film, though it is not his favorite one. It has a long segment of babies which bores me and my son sometimes loses interest, but it's okay.",Positive
"I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals.  I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months, I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies.  My daughter this loves this video.  She asks to watch it multiple times every day.  Sometimes we have to hide it.  She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies, one on dogs, and one on farm animals.  My daughter loves each one.  Plus they are very educational.  If there is a new baby on the way, I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies.  It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like.",Positive
"Ok Ok Ok. I am not in love with Elmo, my daughter is. I do not find him as likeable as the other Sesame Street puppets...Anyway also the concept of the Elmo's world DVDs is not really that appealing to an adult...but apparently kids love it",Positive
"My daughter doesn't watch much television, and when she does it is usually Dora, Miffy or Blue's Clues on Noggin.  So, I didn't know if she would be interested in this Elmo DVD when she got it for her first birthday.  But now I know that regardless of the main character, babies and doggies are a sure winner.  Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part, and it really gets my daughter's attention.  All in all I do recommend this DVD.  It shows alot, but isn't too fast paced.  Also, there are some very adorbale scenes.  But by the time the farm segment starts my daughter has usually lost interest.",Positive
"Elmo is so entrancing, I have no idea how he does it, but when this DVD is on, my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals.  Something about babies makes other babies want to watch.  Thanks to Elmo, I get some much needed ""Me time""...Although this DVD gets old for me some days, it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!",Positive
"My son received this for his second birthday back in October of 2004 and it has become one of his most favorite DVDs to watch and is one of the 15 or so in his regular viewing rotation.  Kids love watching videos with babies and dogs in them and that's the theme of this DVD.  Elmo learns about what babies eat, how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them.  Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm.  Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables.  This was a fun and educational DVD for kids from toddler all the way through early elementary school, done with the usual Elmo flair, songs and silliness.  A classic!",Positive
My little one is ga ga for Elmo and this gives it up in spades.  She really likes this one and it's perfect for someone her age-around 15months.,Positive
"Elmo does it again -- steals the show as a dusty but lovable little monster ""Cinderelmo"" who toils with housework while his evil step mom and step brothers get ready for the Princess Birthday Ball.  The music is infectious, the characters all play memorable parts, the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt), The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell).  I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!",Positive
watched this movie when i was small and i wanted my daughter to watch it too didnt think i would find movie,Positive
"A postively delightful treat for the youngsters, with plenty of jibes thrown in that only the adults will get.  Keri Russel is friendly on the eyes and Oliver Platt has a blast.  No one is too mean, but nothing is too  sappy.  The humor is reverant, but kid-friendly.  How do the Henson folks  do it so consistently?  Buy this; your toddler will love it, and it won't  drive you insane.",Positive
"I run an in home daycare and try to find fun vidoes for the children, I must admit I even thought this was cute, not too often I can say that.  Thanks",Positive
"This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, ""Hello"".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The ""people"" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.  Two thumbs up!",Positive
"John Riley has been playing and teaching the drumset for many years and has written well regarded books.Here he joins the growing number of drummers who are featured on their own DVD - some would say deservedly so.He shows a few of his favourite phrases (as played by the jazz masters), how these can be changed around and a personal statement made.John also goes into the personal aspect of how to relate to other musicians in your band and the positive consequences of speaking a common language and listening to each other - a point he illustrates when he breaks down a solo he played live.I liked very much the story he tells about getting up to play with Dizzy Gillespie and not knowing the songs Dizzy was asking for - John's personal feeling about how Dizzy reacted says so much and illustrates such a compassionate way for musicians to relate to each other that I was emotionally affected by it.I also was also affected by it as I realised not many musicians would react the way Dizzy did - you'll have to see the DVD to understand what I mean.I do wonder how many younger musicians will make the long hard journey to discovering that listening to others is the best way to play music.If you are interested in how to swing or how to feel the 'swing pulse', then go no further than this DVD.If there was one thing I could add to this DVD, it would have been live footage of John performing with a band.I wholeheartedly recommend it.",Positive
"John Riley's books are great and so is this DVD. It was well worth the purchase for me, if for no other reason then for the tip about stick wax, which I'd never heard anyone mention to me before. I began using it immediately and I really love it! But the playing is phenomenal and the DVD is loaded with many examples, when worked on as instructed will strengthen your groove tremendously. Thanks John!",Positive
"This is one of the best, if not THE best instructional and informational videos on jazz drumming available anywhere. I can't say enough good things about it. John has a gift when it comes to explaining and demonstrating these things, and I highly recommend this video as well as his books.",Positive
"Which would be ""John Scofield Live 3 Ways""  Great DVD with John Riley on drums with John in a quartet setting with Cox on Bass and Joe Lovano. This is the longest part of a three segment DVD.",Positive
"This is your typical teen/chick flick, but it is still funny and even guys will enjoy it.  But the main two reasons to get this movie: Marla Sokoloff and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe.  These girls are certainly easy on the eyes and make for excellent viewing.  Collin Hanks also makes what I think is his movie debut in this film.",Positive

"It's a teen exploitation movie. That means you already know the plot. Gut has hots for girl and is willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to get her, even be incredibly stupid. That's what the genre is all about so people should not be surprised when that happens. In essence, guys, especially young ones, tend to do hilarious things to satisfy their...desires. This movie goes a step better.Synopsis: one of the school geeks is infatuated by the head cheerleader but lives next door to the proverbial ""beautiful girl next door"". A cousin of the head cheerleader, a jock, wants to add the ""girl next door"" to his scorecard. The two guys get togther to make each other's fantasies come true. Along the way, the ""nice ones"" learn important lessons and the ""not so nice"" ones get their comeuppance. Its as predictable as the sunset. It's still funny.Where this movie does its best is in the way it charactures the popular people. They are usually depicted as shallow and vapid. They still are but are taken to new heights of idiocy. It's fun to see them get taken down a peg by some nice kids who find each other.Don't expect any education from this film. Its strictly for laughs. Its not the best but it is certainly entertaining.",Positive
"I'm a an avid viewer of all the teen horrors and comedies that have been  recently coming out. This is one of the bests. Of course, the plot is  predictable, and you have your usual type-cast people (e.g. nerds, jocks,  the beautiful ones. It's just the humour in this movie is better than any  other. Besides 10 Things I Hate About You, but other than, it is! The  actors/actresses really did their part for the movie. Especially Jodi Lynn  O'Keefe who is always awesome at playing the beautiful one. I recommend you  check this one out!",Positive
"It has taken me a while to get around to checking out this 2000 teen romantic comedy for the simply reason that when it came out I had actually finished writing a movie script for the first time and it was a teen romantic comedy entitled &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; (using the song from Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's first solo album as inspiration) and I was crushed by cruel fate once again taunting me.  But I was having a good week so I thought I could stand to watch this and not curse the heavens.  Of course I somehow missed out on the 1999 &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; which had Andrew Dice Clay and Fred Williamson in a film about undercover cops checking out steroid use by body builders, the 1998 animated short by director Joanna Quinn, the 1993 sexploitation comedy by director Michael Quarles, and the 1986 drama starring Martin Balsam.  Gee, if only I had stopped crying long enough to find out that films were coming out with this title every year I could still done nothing but felt better about it.This particular version of &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; was hurt by the idea that it was a modern version of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac,&quot; the way &quot;Ten Things I Hate About You&quot; is an updated &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; is a teenage version of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons.&quot;  However, while we do have a version of the famous balcony scene, there is a big difference in that this time around the scene is missing the pivotal irony that a man who is in love with a woman gives another man the words to woe her (although the scene is a pivotal moment in the film).  So the &quot;Cyrano&quot; connection is a minor one, especially compared to Steve Martin's &quot;Roxanne.&quot;The situation is that Ryan Woodman (Shane West) has the hots for the school's reigning sex goddess, Ashley Grant (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe).  Ryan is a good kid who has the twin misfortunes of playing the accordion and having a mother (Julia Sweeney) who is the school nurse.  Meanwhile, the campus bad boy jock, Chris Campbell (James Franco) wants to add good girl Maggie Carter (Marla Sokoloff) to his list of conquests.  Ryan and Maggie are nextdoor neighbors whose bedroom balconies almost touch and who have been best friends almost since birth, while Chris happens to be Ashley's cousin.  So Chris comes up with the great idea that he and Ryan can help each other get the girl that they want.The only real problem with this story line is that Ryan falls way behind the audience in terms of realizing the truth about both Ashley and Maggie.  The cinematic reference I flashed on during this film was actually &quot;10.&quot;  But if Ryan is slow on the uptake this &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; gets redeemed because West and Sokoloff really do come across as nice kids and the pivotal scenes are the best in the film, which really saves it.  The homage to the &quot;Cyrano&quot; balcony scene is probably the best in the film, the grand gesture required of Ryan turns out to be an elegantly simple example of public humiliation in the name of true love, and Maggie carries off a nice case of the requisite comeuppance.  That is not bad for any sort of teen romantic comedy, even one with a title for which lots of people apparently like to write scripts.",Positive
"This movie is the most predictible film I have ever seen, In the first 30 seconds you can guess how it will end... But does it matter! it's a light hearted teen flick that will guarentee to leave you with a laugh and a bit of a warm tingly feeling too! Shane West (Get over it) and Marla sokoloff (Dude where's my car) give great performances and are joined by formed SNL cast members Julia Sweeney (Pat) and David Koechner. The best part is this special collectors edition DVD features deleted scenes a behind the scenes featurette and commentary by cast members and directors... what are you waiting for check it out and spread the word of Virgil doolittle!",Positive
"This was, a interesting movie and pretty silly, even though there weren't  many, famous people it is still, good also saw this in theatres. You'll  love it!",Positive
"When I first saw the trailer to this film, I honestly wasn't impressed. It just looked like another pointless teen film (like &quot;She's All That&quot;). When I rented this film I wasn't expecting much. And when I watched it for my first time, I didn't get much. HOWEVER.. when I watched it again (a day later), I realized that this really is a great film. So what I'm saying here is, be optimistic about this film, or you may not enjoy it.Anyway.. in my opinion, this is a great teen flick!",Positive
"While watching WHATEVER IT TAKES, I thought I was watching just another teen movie. However, during the last third of the movie, the film became original. The parodies became a salute to one of the greatest films ever made, and a lesson was taught. Not too bad for a movie among myriads aimed at teens.The movie takes the story of Cyrano de Bergerac, but with a few changes. There are no ugly people here, even the geeks are attractive. Also, instead of one person using another to win the heart of a woman he thinks he can never win, the movie uses two; a geek becomes friends with a jock so he can get the school's beauty queen to love him and the jock uses the geek to get the geek's best friend to fall for him.The movie contains a message about staying true to oneself. The message is delivered in such a way that it seeps into one's conscience without knowing it. Also, towards the end of the movie there is a great scene taken directly out of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The movie doesn't parody that film, but in the nod of acknowledgement it does poke fun of TITANIC.Overall, an average romantic comedy that's a lot better than the average teen movie.",Positive
I couldn't get enough of Riverdance and had to get the next rendition of it even though there were some changes in people. It's such a treat to watch,Positive
"(Note: I geared this review towards Irish dancing fans who want to buy a Riverdance, but are not sure which one to get.)This is by far the best Riverdance to get, for several reasons. It is of higher quality: better stage, better costumes, etc.Also, there are great extra songs what the other does not have, such as:Trading Taps has a little &quot;showdown&quot; between three Irish dancers and two American black jazz dancers. It is very entertaining, humerous, and all around enjoyable. I really missed that in the first Riverdance. Oscail an Doras: One of my favorite Irish songs overall! It combines drums, singing and dancing. It also has a wonderful tune and great harmonies.Lift the Wings is a duet with a man and woman, and that really enhances the song.  It is beautiful.Freedom is much better. I did not like the Baptist choir they had. I have nothing against that style of music, but it definately did not fit with this show one bit. Now they have the regular singers performing, as well as a man with a really deep bass voice. Kind of like the man who sang &quot;Old Man River&quot; from Showboat.Firedance is not a duet. Maria Pages definately has enough charisma and presence to do a solo, and, IMHO, it is much better that way. Also, Michael Flately cannot do any suggestive petting.Besides having differences, this movie keeps many of the same winning features of the last one, such as the beautiful and talented Jean Butler (I swear she floats when she dances); the wonderful lady lead singer whose name I do not know, but has a hauntingly, achingly gorgeous voice; and the same great songs. Now I shall tell the best asset: Colin Dunne. Michael Flatley may think he is lord of the Dance, but Colin Dunne IS the dance. All one has to do is look at his face, and see the expression of pure bliss. The best thing about him is that, to him, the audience dissapears, which obviously does not happen with Michael Flatley. Flatley is a performer, and, while there is nothing wrong with that, that interferes with the actual show. I think the best way to compare the two is to look at how they stand after some dances.  After Reel Around the Sun, Flately stands straight up with his arms outstretched, obstructing the view of the dancers behind him. Dunne, after another song, stands with is head down, and hands pointing backwards towards them, drawing the viewer's gaze backwards. One more thing: I have seen it mentioned on other reviews that Dunne's chemistry with Jean Butler was not as good as Flatley's. I disagree; it is better. The only person Flatley has chemistry with is himself. Dunne and Butler have respect for eachother; that is obvious.In short, if you are getting one Riverdance, get this one. If you can get both, get both! For, as some people say, the camera is not always used to its full potential. However, it is hardly bothersome. I can assure you that you will be hard pressed to find a better-spent 2 hours than the time spent watching this film.",Positive
"Watching the fast-paced Irish step-dancing that dominates this performance, you wonder how the dancers can keep from falling over their own feet, extensive practice notwithstanding.  Though there are a few segments that seem out of place (a flamenco dancer, a sequence featuring a black ensemble), most of the video is made up of dance numbers using traditional instruments and footwork from the Emerald Isle.  When I first watched it I was blown away.  I still am.  If you have only *one* dance performance video in your collection, this should be it.",Positive
"This is a ""revised"" Riverdance presentation, staged at Radio City Music hall in New York City. Of the three Irish ""dance"" musicals that I watched during the mid to late '90s (which includes the first ""Riverdance"" and ""Lord of the Dance"") I liked this one the best.I thought it was better than the original, held in Dublin, Ireland, because it adds segments that are mostly good, it has a more varied and colorful stage setting and it eliminated apiece for two from that original that wasn't good to begin with. This is just a very solid show with few weak spots. To be certain, there are some songs/dances that are just ""fair"" but none that are poor, which is amazing considering there are 20 numbers in all.The cast is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception of Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the featured dancer. Both are extremely talented. The major difference might be in their looks with Dunne a little, goateed black-haired guy while Flatley is the clean-shaven blond. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big he gets annoying at times. The female lead, Jean Butler, thankfully, is still there and is great to watch: what graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the greatest legs I've seen on dancers.I also enjoyed the dancing of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with those two pairing off against Dunne and two other dancers - is called ""Trading Taps"" and is terrific fun to watch, maybe the highlight of the whole show. I have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers, either.The ""fast"" Irish songs here appealed to me the most. I appreciated the audience not getting in the way of the performance either with shrieks and screams like the women do in the ""Lord Of The Dance"" video.",Positive
"Let me just say this, I am an Irish dancer, have been dancing with some modest success off and on for 15 years or more.I've even performed in a mini Riverdance/LOTD type show. Affectionatly called Puddledance. :-)So here goes: I like both shows, I also like both dancers (i.e. Colin vs. Michael)Yes MF probably has/had more skill than Colin. However Colin is a much less ego-centric person and is IMHO easier and at times more enjoyable to watch.I appreciate what MF has brought to both shows, however I find Riverdance a better overall production and here is why;1. The costumes do not look like some tacky combination between the worst of Irish dance competition wear and a Vegas showgirl show. They are simple, subtle and work well with the dancing. (Have you seen Feet of Flames and that ridiculous cape they made Dair nolan dance with!! Or the UGLY catsuit they put the Gypsy girl in..oh god the list is endless...)ANY show knows you need to have appropriate costumes to carry off the theme fo the show. I wish someone had told MF that.2. As much as MF is/was a brilliant dancer and is a pretty good coreographer he spends way too much time in the world of ME ME ME and does not show even half the joy Colin shows when he is dancing. Nor does he let his co-stars shine too brightly, lest they dim his own star. I really do like the man folks but it is so OBVIOUS. And I am sorry just becuase the man has done so well does not give him an excuse to be so arrogant that is not OK in my book at all. Humility will get you more acolades than arrogance.3. Riverdance is more well rounded it doesn't go over the top, it shows you a good mix of what Irish dancing is, what it can be and shows how it compares and contrasts with other forms of Dance. That in and of itself makes it a bit stronger than all the MF shows combined.4. Colin vs. Michael is just silly, two different men, two diffent skill levels. And honestly Colin does more actual ""Irish"" dancing than Michael has done in ALL the shows combined. MF style is more a hybrid of Irish and US Tap dancing with WAY too much posturing and goofing around without as much real dancing going on. So the fact is does Colin make mistakes? Yes, of course he does, Irish dance is VERY difficult dance style in many ways it is as dificult and requires as much training as Ballet. But it is even more complex than ballet and every single Irish dancer in the world has bad days and good days. Unfortunatley sometimes those bad days happen at the wrong moment, i.e. The Grammys.So anyway while I enjoy Mr. Flatley's shows Riverdance is a much stronger show without him and as a whole is a better example of the best of Irish dancing. Regardless of the he said/she said debate over who contributed what, Riverdance had its vision MF had another so they separated. MF was never technically ""fired"" he refused to go on until the issues was resolved the way he wanted and they couldn't reach a middle ground, it happens all the time folks. And personally I'm glad it did, because we got a whole new group of shows that may never had exisited if MF had stayed with Riverdance. I like both as I said, I just think Riverdance is a bit stronger than the various LOTD shows.Now if we could just re-train camera men to properly film these shows it would be lovely!!!!",Positive
"There will never be a winner in the Flantley vs Dunne debate, which is perhaps appropriate, as the true star of the show is the music and dance, ably assisted by Colin Dunne, Jean Butler, Katie McMahon, et al.  The sheer  power of this production is overwhelming.  Even those who are not  afficianados of the dance will be enthralled by the pounding rhythms and  dizzying movements of the dancers.  The joy of Riverdance is apparent in  the interplay between the performers, masterfully captured in this video.  When the dancers are enjoying themselves, the audience feeds on the  enthusiasm, and a performance becomes a memorable event.  Riverdance - Live  from New York City is just such an occasion.  If I ever find a time  machine, I'm going back to catch the premier!  What a show!",Positive
"Recorded at The Point in Dublin - THE ORIGINAL staging after the incredible response to the Eurovision performance when Ireland was the host country. Even includes Michael Flatley and Jean Butler from the Eurovision performance. This is where it all started. Good enough for VHS, but where is the DVD?",Positive
"By now, ""Riverdance"" has become an indelible part of popular culture, both exalted as a brilliant one-of-a--kind theatrical experience and exhausted as a concept by copycat companies around the world -- and Las Vegas (think Michael Flatley)!  The original Riverdance, however, is a thrilling ride - a lyrical tale of the evolution of dance set against the Irish struggle for Independence.  For sheer magic, however, you don't need to be Irish to appreciate the beauty and grace with which this story is told...both in music and dance.  Although newer companies may visit your town every year around St. Patty's Day, the original Riverdance is a coup of the human spirit - a dizzying swirl of gosamer feet that seem to lift off the stage.  Seeing ""Riverdance"" in person during its first incarnation was easily one of the top 10 highlights in my own theater loving life.  But - instead of splurging for tickets to a sub-par production, I heartily recommend watching this DVD first.  That way, you'll experience the magic as it was meant to be experienced and then be able to decide if you really need to see it on stage.  Beware of poor imitators like Flatley, whose ""Feet of Flames"" is a bit over the (narcisistic top) --- just plug in this DVD, crank up the volume, and bear witness to the original one-of-a-kind thrill-ride that IS ""Riverdance.""  I bet you'll find yourself applauding after most of the numbers, and unexpectedly starting a standing ovation in  your living room before you even know it!  An astounding musical dance work of art!",Positive
"The Flatley-vs.-Dunne controversy finds us enjoying both versions of the show greatly. Yes, Flatley is more of an extrovert than Colin Dunne; Flatley is a one-of-a-kind performer/choreographer - but that fact doesn't make Dunne chopped liver, and in fact Dunne dances terrifically in this version of the show. (Rightly considered, it is even to Flatley's credit as the creator and ""owner"" of the show, that ""Riverdance"" survived his departure.)Dunne dances brilliantly, and collaborates very well with Jean Butler. Dunne's reserve is a kind of classical manner, and not at all any lack of ""gusto."" This is particularly obvious in the sequence which begins as a 'duet' between Maria Pag&eacute;s and a drummer, and which turns into a trio as Dunne appears in a spotlight. Likewise, the call-&-response of the ""Trading Taps"" sequence is fabulous; if anyone seeing Dunne dance this, finds him an ""empty technician,"" why, perhaps there is something to be said for ""empty technique"" after all ....Pag&eacute;s is always a treat, and was always the ""third principal"" in this show for us. Composer Bill Whelan pulls off some charming sonic feats, by making a small, and mostly Irish-folk-instrument, pit band provide perfectly convincing accompaniments not only for the Irish dance numbers, but for Pag&eacute;s' brilliant flamenco, and for the (strangely heterogeneous, though this will escape most Western viewers) pan-former-Soviet-Union stuff danced by former members of the Moiseyev Company, a troupe which is internationally renowned for their brilliant folk dancing, folk dancing produced at a level on par with Russian ballet, which of course is one of the great dance traditions on the planet.The ""choral"" sections are our least favorite part of the show. The ""behind-the-scenes footage"" is little more than a euphemism for a brief commercial for the show, pleasant to watch, of course, but we felt that there was an opportunity missed for much more material of real interest. Yes, the frantic editing is sometimes a distraction (and there are shots which cut out the dancers' feet, and pans from the back of the hall, which could be done without nicely).None of these minor complaints, though, seriously detracts from the impact of the show.",Positive
"I went to a performance in Raleigh, NC and enjoyed it so much I bought the DVD version right away.  The DVD will give you a taste of the great music that makes up the show.  I was lucky enough to have center stage 12 row back tickets so I was able to see everything extremely well.  I was amazed at how fast their feet moved!  Thanks to the various camera angles you can see the same thing at home.  There were a couple of things that unfortuantely didn't make it into the DVD version that were a couple of the many highlights for me personally.  The first was a part where a woman was crouched down and was spun around by her dancing partner.  The highlight here to me was the fact that she was spun around about as fast as the ice skaters spin.  I couldn't believe she could keep her balance while on one foot and be spun around so fast.  The other was the ""street"" dancers routine was cut down a little in the DVD version.  Despite lacking those 2 items, however, this DVD is an easy 5 stars and should be purchased without hesitation for yourself or for someone else as a gift.  As with all recorded shows, I recommend seeing them live as well if you get a chance, it's truly an amazing evening.",Positive
"With tremendous applause and a standing ovation at the 1994 Eurovision's 7 minute intermission; Michael Flatley, Jean Butler, and an Irish troupe of dancers tapped their way into the record books. It was all that was talked about that night long ago. ""Riverdance"" was born soon after.The show was filmed at the Point Theater in Dublin, Ireland and the stage there is perfect. The co-ordination and speed of the Irish taps were spectacular to watch as the Riverdance troupe went through their opening number, ""Reel Around the Sun"". Michael Flatley came out with such speed that he takes in the whole stage. He's got such carisma that he makes you feel he's dancing just for you. Anuna, with the fabulous Kate McMahon, sing songs that are hauntingly beautiful. Maria Pages does her exquisite spanish, ""Firedance"". She starts out dancing alone, then Michael joins her. (Cute couple to watch) Jean Butler is lovely and a joy to watch in her opening number ""The Countess Cathleen""; she has such cute facial expressions! The older women that sings ""Lift the Wings"" brought shivers down my spine. I just love that song! ""Freedom"" was done by a gospel choir and I can't forget ""The Russian Dervish"", which was very colorful; performed by three men and three women, who do some amazing stunts as they twirl through this number. This video came out in 1995; a very dynamic and breathtaking experience. It celebrates Irish dancing at its best. I hope it will be back on the shelf soon so people can experience this presentation of Irish dancing and song. I loved every minute of it.",Positive
"Great music, great dancing, great story -- in short, sensational. Riverdance is STILL in a worldwide tour, years after Michael Flatley left. The hypnotic dancing moves, the romantic sweep and the Celtic rhythms are truly mesmerizing. In the past couple of years it has become hip to slam Riverdance, but that is only because of its stratospheric popularity. Riverdance is exhilarating entertainment that lifts you up and leaves you with simple joy in life itself.I can't think of anything we need more given the events of the past month.Peace.",Positive
"Our 4-year old enjoyed it, with a little explanation in order about Miss Clavel's habit, and about the motives of the kidnappers.A very nice extra on the DVD is an old 1952 animated short based closely on the original Bemelmans book, with the text and cartoon style nearly identical. Amusingly, Miss Clavel is therein depicted as a sort of governess, rather than as a nun; perhaps a sign of the times, or maybe the cartoon's producers were not Catholic?I thought Hatty Jones did great in the title role -- wonder what ever happened to her?",Positive
"I don't watch many movies, and have recently lost my taste for kids' movies in particular--which are also the few movies which don't have gratuitous sex, violence, and cursing. This movie manages to transcend genres, a witty film that those who have outgrown the ""Madeleine"" cartoons will enjoy.Madeleine, played by the excellent Hatty Jones, is a little French girl at a boarding school in France, along with eleven other girls (also flawlessly acted) and their teacher Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand). The movie follows her clashes with the Spanish ambassador's son, Pepito, and with Lord ""Cuckooface"" Covington, the man who owns the school upon the death of their sponsor--and who wants to close it down; also with such problems as a ransom plot, and the loyal dog Genevieve.Madeleine purists should be warned: this movie is not just a live-action version of the book stories. The movie exists as a series of vignettes loosely based on the books, such as Madeleine's appendectomy and her rescue by Genevieve. Two of the central plots are not in the books, however: Lord Covington's wish to sell the school, and the kidnapping plot concerning Pepito. Occasionally dialogue will be lifted (a difficulty, given the almost complete lack of REAL dialogue) such as Miss Clavel's midnight ""Something is not right"" or Madeleine's defiant ""pooh pooh!""The actors and script contain the necessary amount of innocent cuteness and comedy (the visits of the various ambassadors to the school) while also having poignancy. One thing that will irritate Madeleine purists is Madeleine's family situation in this movie, but it does give her the ability to interact with Lord Covington.McDormand is excellent as the rather put-upon nun Miss Clavel, who stiffly glides through real life while trying to keep her twelve little girls in something approaching order without squelching them. Thank God the old ""authority figure as clown"" thing never came into play. Hatty Jones is cute and sprightly without being annoyingly so, while the actresses for such characters as Vicki and Chantal are perfect in their roles. The girls REGISTER as being real people. So does Kristian de la Osa, as the attention-hungry Pepito--the movie hints quietly at why he is such a ""bad hat,"" while simultaneously giving us sympathy for him and Madeleine alike. And kudos to the best original character, Helene the cook!Music is overall very good (thankfully no one breaks into spontaneous song) with sedate music playing for Miss Clavel and the girls, sad music during poignant moments, and excellent Spanish numbers as we focus on Pepito. The final number stinks, though, it clashes with the setting and plotline.The minimal violence is cartoonish and there is no innuendo; one (bad word) creeps into the script, via a bad guy.This movie is a delight from start to finish, a witty and charming movie that will take you back to your childhood. Or if you didn't like your childhood, it'll take you somewhere nice...",Positive
"A really exquisite movie that will make you laugh, cry, and keep putting it on again for moreThe movie is about a girls school in Paris and the adventures of 12 adorable little girls, with the cutest and most interesting of all being the plucky flame haired little tyke, with a heart of gold Madeline (Hatty Jones).With adventures taken from the timeless books, including little Madeleine's appendicitis, and her rescue from the water by the golden retriever Genevieve, the centerpiece of the story is the battle of the girls and their loving guardian Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) to keep their school and their dog, against the cruel plans of Lord Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and also foiling a thuggish tutor cum kidnapper Leopold (Ben Daniels)This is really beautiful, not only for kids, but for all young at heart aged  2 to 122 years of age.There are just so many wonderful memorable heart-stealing scenes, funny cute and poignant.",Positive
"I bought this DVD for my 3 year old neice and she loves it!  If you have young relatives, or children of your own, this DVD is great.  It is not too long, and it is a great break for any fan of Madeline.  My neice Taylor gave this DVD 4 stars!  That is better than my recommendation.",Positive
"While the movie isn't exactly the same as the book (what movie is?) the film was overall faithful to the spirit of the book, and the girl who plays Madeline did a nice job in her part. I also liked Ms. Clavel. The storyline is engaging, and if you liked the books, then this movie should please you, since it is written rather well with a believable story.",Positive
"Madeline is one of those movies that looks so childish. You don't see many kids today saying, ""What did you do yesterday?"" ""I went to the video store."" ""Oh, really? What'd you get?""""Madeline."" But really, it's much more better and cute than it looks! Madeline is a French schoolgirl who lives in a Catholic boarding-school with 11 other girls and their dorm-mother, er., nun, Ms. Chavel. The beginning shows how Madeline has to go through the pain of having her appendix taken out and then, when a new Spanish boy named Pepito comes in to live next door, chaos erupts. Some of the girls like Pepito, but Madeline doesn't, and it doesn't help any when she becomes the brunt of a few of his pranks either.Basically, it's war: Pepito vs. everyone else. After awhile, though, Madeline and Pepito figure out that it's much more fun to use the pranks they're been doing to each other on people they both don't like. However, the underlying issue is that Pepito is lonely because his parents never spend much time with him, and even though they hire an apperently ""fun"" new tutor, all isn't what it seems. Unknown trouble ensues when Ms. Chavel wants the girls to play with Pepito and his new ""tutor"", and keen Madeline begins to get wiff of a fishy plot. Everyone soon forgets about that, however, when Madeline finds a new dog, Genevieve, and Genevieve quickly becomes the whole boarding-school's pet.A negative blow to this positive surprise unfolds when the dorm's elderly, rich owner discovers the dog and takes her away, also declaring the news that he is planning to sell the school, news that Ms. Chavel has secretly known all along. Shocked but hardly intimidated, Madeline gets on her two feet and decides to save the school, reclaim Genevieve, and help Pepito out with his troubled family life once and for all. The exciting, thrilling ending just states that much clearly that you can never judge a book by it's cover, or in this case, a video by it's box. Funny, cute, and adventurous, Madeline is the perfect treat for a family night in with your little ones or just for some clean, funny entertainment.",Positive
"I was a little apprehensive about watching this film since I had such fond memories of the book.  And Frances McDormand as a nun...  she who played in so many of the bloody Coen brothers movies?!Not to worry!  The whole film perfectly captured the magic and charm of the original.  In fact I think it improved on it.  And McDormand was wonderful as Ms. Clavell!  She played her just right---proper and strict but warm hearted and funny, too.  I loved her ride in the old Deux Chevaux with Genevieve, the Lab, beside her.  It's a role that could have been terrible hammed up but FM was perfect.  It's nice not to see nuns caricatured.Hatty Jones was just right as Madeline, too.  Having cringed at too many cutesy child performers I was wary about this, too.  But, again, this Madeline was just the right mix of cute, spunky and smart....none of those qualities being overplayed.The whole cast was terrific.  I enjoyed the appearances of the various Ambassadors, from the Spanish one and his wife who lived next door to the ones from Liberia and Uzbekistan who were house shopping.  Each one was just perfect.  Great dog, too!Last but not least was the amazing city of Paris!  There were just enough beautiful shots of the city to add to the enjoyment of the film.The director did a super job of presenting this material in a way that hit all the right tones.  The story is really sort of silly but it's told in a way that totally lifts your heart into that place of childhood magic and innocence.",Positive
I was 10 when this came out and was so excited in 1998. Its still an adorable movie - no spoilers its a mash up of the 1st Madeline books and several others Ludwig B. created.,Positive
"Every little girl has wanted to become the incorrigibly adventurous Madeline as introduced by children's writer Ludwig Bemelman and this movie brings her to new life.Madeline (Hatty Jones) resides in a French orphanage, wears a little blue suit and cap and creates havoc wherever she goes. Help is only a step away with Miss Clavel (Frances McDormand) at hand and she rescues little Madeline often and with good cheer. But the orphanage is scheduled to be sold by the owner Lord ""Cucuface"" Covington (Nigel Hawthorne) and the girls who live with Madeline devise a plan to save their home. All sorts of antics take place against the backdrop of the beautiful Parisian scenery that surrounds the worried little orphans.Hatty Jones is really superb as the classically mischievous orphan in blue, Madeline. Hatty has the perfect button nose and red hair to pull off the look but she also manages to capture the impish thoughts of the little character as well. Frances McDormand is highly likable as the Sister who adores her home full of orphans. Nigel Hawthorne pulls off the uppity roll of a wealthy property owner who could care less about the future of a few bratty orphans. But it is the beautiful city of Paris that steals the show, with glimpses of perfection at every corner how could an orphan in Paris ever be sad. No wonder little Madeline has remained such a happy sight for generations of children and adults.",Positive
This is educational and fun. Now i don't have to wipe down the floor after evey time nature calls. Period.PS: The whiney mouse is a riot.,Positive
"Bear and his friends sing and dance to introduce the concept of going to the toilet (or potty).  They tell how to know you need to go, and explain that sometimes there are accidents, but that it is worth it to wear underwear instead of diapers.  There are some real children who talk about how they love going to the toilet.  And a very strange shadow puppet rap showing that people all over the world go to the toilet.  Don't know about results yet, but at least it is an entertaining video.",Positive
"This is another in a great line of ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" releases. The episode is ""When You've Got to Go..."" in which the Bear characters are all talking about using the potty.It all starts when Tutter wants to finish a game of checkers, but has to go to the bathroom. He learns that when you're doing something exciting, it'll still be waiting for you, but if you have to go to the bathroom, you should go. Kids will also learn that they should wash their hands after using the toilet (minor nitpick --- Tutter forgets to flush and has to go back, but does not wash again).Later, Ojo has an accident. She learns that it's okay and to listen to her body. And Treelo learns about how he and everyone in the Big Blue House was once in diapers, but now they're not anymore.This video has some great humor and wonderful songs. The shadow segment can be a bit scary, if you or your kids don't just find it plain funny. Otherwise, this video is pretty great.This video is Hi-Fi, recorded in SP mode and close-captioned, just like most of the other Bear video releases. It also includes trailers for Stuart Little, Muppets from Space, The Muppet Movie and other Bear video releases.This video is also available in a DVD version.",Positive
"This is a terrific teaching and entertaining video to aid in learning basic potty needs and steps. It certainly ""speaks"" to children on their level in clear and uncomplicated terms. The video uses situations that will be familiar to children and are carried out in both a simple and compassionate manner. When my child first saw this video he was beyond mesmerized. I think he watched it at least 4 or 5 times a day for several days in a row. This certainly is not common practice in our house, however due to his intense interest in the (agreeable to me) subject matter I allowed the viewings. My child is in the active threshold of potty training now. I believe when I first bought the video he had just been introduced to this new world of ""pottydom"". It has been a considerable time since my child has seen this video, but after having an accident this past weekend in cloth underpants he immediately began reciting the videos' basic potty instruction theme in a very thorough and understanding manner. Cleary it has left a significant and lasting (positive) impression on him.",Positive
This was used with two different grandchildren when they were potty trained.  It was a real help.,Positive
"I bought this dvd for my 24month old son. I've been potty training him since he was 18m with great success but he had a backslide, having accidents about 4x a week. Now, he grabs himself and says POTTY and runs to the bathroom. Before he was using a potty chair, now he only uses the toilet (I think because he saw Tutter using the toilet). Aside from the potty training he loves the singing and he loves all of the animals on the show. I also recommend Bear in the Big Blue House: Colors and Shapes. These dvd's are so cute my little one watches them every day!",Positive
"This &quot;Carole King-In Concert&quot; DVD was filmed in 1994, as part of her &quot;Colour of Your Dreams&quot; album tour.  While it is, she says of one portion, part memory lane trip, part music history, it is very much a rousing in-the-moment concert with none of the mustiness of an oldies or comeback gig to it (though this particular video has all the pedigree of a PBS fundraiser concert, filmed in an upscale concert hall, with a very well manicured, polite, not-very-diverse boomer audience).  Working since the late fifties, King has written much of the music that helped define pop culture ever since, mostly by other performers.  Here are &quot;Natural Woman,&quot; &quot;Chains,&quot; &quot;One Fine Day,&quot; &quot;Take Good Care of My Baby,&quot; as well as some she debuted on her own &quot;Tapestry&quot; album.  (I thought it odd at first that &quot;Tapestry&quot; itself was not on this DVD, but I can see where it really doesn't fit so logically with the rest of the selections.)  The music rocks.  So does King, who looks wonderful and is a role model for aging gracefully (if almost invisibly!).  Her voice is strong and rich.  DVD options are not availed much in this product, though they are used to outline the highlights of an extraordinary, award-winning and often behind-the-scenes career.",Positive
"***** 4.5 stars *****I bought this Carole King video having been completely captivated by the CD release. It's amazing to see that the whole recording was done in ""real"" time, as there were no overdubs or retakes (seemingly, anyway).  The vocals and the musicianship are totally top-notch.So, what made me buy the film was the Brill Building medley that was not included on the CD release.  For some reason, I got it in my head that a film with footage of King and Gerry Goffin in their halycon songwriting days would be superimposed over the vocals.  It wasn't, and I was disappointed I had the wrong idea about the video.  Also, King's version of her excellent song ""One Fine Day,"" as represented here, is a brief, one-verse take, over before you know it.Minor quibbles in an otherwise brilliant concert.  King was at the peak of her form here, and it shows.",Positive
"If you haven't heard any of Carole's music since Tapestry, hold on to your hat.  Her style has evolved, but not unrecognizably so.  And her wonderful voice and talent are the same.The Dolby Digital 5.1 audio quality is quite good.  The visual quality is high  enough to watch at a widescreen setting with only a tiny loss of sharpness.  Each song is a chapter, so you can easily go to a particular song.  My  only criticism is that the dvd is very dark in places.  I would have preferred softer lighting  on the stage with fewer spotlights and shadows.I loved seeing Carole at the piano for several songs during this concert. That's  the Carole that I remember.  But how fun it is to see Carole facing the audience, singing, dancing, and inviting them to join in on a chorus of one of the old  favorites.  This is a must-see for any Carole King fan.",Positive
"Just rented this movie, was curious to see her live, my sister is a huge fan. I liked this DVD, not only did she still look great back then, her voice hasnt changed that much from the 70s. I was surprised to see Slash in this show, (strange pairing) but he does rock the house with his blistering solos. Love the oldies more than the new stuff but thats me...great show even though its over 10 years old.",Positive
"This CD was great!  It featured many of Carole King's greatest songs.  My only negative comment would be that it didn't include ALL of Ms. King's hits from Tapestry.  For example if you are a fan of ""Way Over Yonder"", you won't find it on this DVD.  However, all fans of Carole King's should find that this DVD is very enjoyable.",Positive
Excellent quality video and 5.1 audio.  Carol was in top form and everything sounded great.  Band obviously had a great time.,Positive
"What is it about Carole King?  Her voice is pleasant, though not magnificent, and in this performance she occasionally reaches for notes she has no chance of hitting.  Her instrumental skills are passable, but certainly not extraordinary.  Yet there is something about watching this songstress perform her own varied and often exquisite compositions. There is an authenticity to the music that no one else could possibly render.  You distinctly perceive in her delivery that you are bearing witness to the true heart of the song.And Carole King has a remarkable catalog to witness.  This 85 minute video is only a sampling of her output.  Late in the concert King offers an 'Old Song Medley', performing snippits of memorable tunes she has penned, such as 'Take Good Care of My Baby', 'One Fine Day', and 'Go Away Little Girl', giving one a feel for the dimensions of her influence.  A glimpse at her train of work reveals other nuggets such as The Monkee's 'Pleasant Valley Sunday', The Animal's 'Don't Bring Me Down' (also featured in the 'Old Songs Medley'), and Herman's Hermit's 'I'm Into Something Good'.The setlist for this performance, recorded in 1993 in Connecticut, is repleat with songs made famous by King, such as a beautiful 'Beautiful', 'Natural Woman', 'Hard Rock Cafe', 'So Far Away', a rollicking 'Jazzman', 'It's Too Late', 'Smackwater Jack', and 'I Feel the Earth Move'.  There is also a parade of King compositions made famous by other performers, such as 'Up On the Roof', 'Will You Love Me Tomorrow', 'Chains', 'You've Got a Friend', and 'Locomotion'.  King also offers up two new compositions, 'Hold Out For Love', and 'Do You Feel Love'.  Both are strong songs that hold their own well here, but of course they lack the nostalgic appeal of the rest of King's work.  Aside from these new compositions, virtually every song King performs brings immediate applause as the audience clues into the opening chords.King is an energetic performer, and of course she is surrounded by an elite, and visually appealing, cast of musicians (Slash from Gun's N' Roses displays unique lead guitar solo's on two numbers that contrast nicely with King's style of music).  In fact the only criticism of this video, and it is a complaint that should be heard by concert video producers worldwide, has to do with the inclusion of audience clips into the program.  While this may be entertaining the first time around, helping the viewer to 'identify' with the audience, it gets a bit annoying to be seeing Jack Slaughter or Tina Tiller for the tenth or eleventh time.  Furthermore, while King and the backing band appear quite youthful (in King's case most likely representing quite an investment), these images only remind us of how old King's fan base is, and probably how old YOU are.There is also the inevitable sing-alongs of highly popular tunes, such as 'You've Got a Friend'.  It happens twice in this video.  King should give the purchasers of her video/DVD a break, and for this one evening keep the audience at bay where they belong, and give us performances of these superb songs without the invited interruptions of a mass of amateurs.For these reasons I rate the video a 4 out of 5.  If you're a Carole King fan, I don't believe you will be disappointed, as the criticisms could be applied to nearly any live concert video.",Positive
Be ready for nearly two hours of fun that's full of energy. This event was a well produced PBS fund raiser. Fortunately on DVD and 5.1 surround sound (as opposed to the initial broadcast) the viewer becomes one of the audience for a true legend of the 1960's & 70's and is still pouring her heart into every lyric and note thus delivering it like a fine aged wine....,Positive
"If you want to really treat yourself to something wonderful, check out this DVD of Carole King, who may be the best female entertainer of all.She has always been great, and I think with a few years on her, she's even better.But I was just totally beguiled by one of her guest musicians - Slash - from Guns 'N Roses.  I had never heard him before, but I don't think I've ever heard a more fantastic guitarist.The talent that these people, at this level, possess is absolutely mesmerizing.I guess there's no limit to the incredible talent some people have, but what's all the more mysterious is how some entertainers, who shall be unnamed, manage to make millions of dollars with no discernible talent whatsoever.However, that's not the case here.  Everybody on this DVD is a pro, and you will be duly impressed.",Positive
Great concert.  She is having fun and it shows.  If only I could go back to those days!,Positive
from one of the Most Important singer/songwriters&all Around Talents in the Music Indsutry. this concert is really cool&Highlights all of her Classics&she sounds&Looks Really Good.,Positive
From start to finish this was a high energy concert.  Carole seemed to be really enjoying herself and it came through in the performance.  The oldies segment was great. If you're interested in buying the audio CD of this show the oldies segment is not on there;  you only get it with this DVD.,Positive
"I'm not a real Carole King fan (although plenty old enough to know about the multi-Grammy winner from the start), but decided to give this 1993 concert a watch based on the strength of the other Amazon reviews.  Whoa!I expected to see a middle-aged woman crooning a medley of ballads while sitting at a piano - with a worn out voice and attitude.  No way!!  King is arguably ""smokin' hot"" in a mini-dress, and is all over the place.  To add to the energy, guitar icon, Slash, stands-in on a couple of tunes and just sets the place on fire (imagine an acid electric lead guitar duel during ""Locomotion"").  In addition, the entire concert band talent is five star -- sax, keyboards, guitar, percussion.If you don't already know it, you'll learn from watching the concert that Carole King was a MAJOR 60's/70's songwriter.  I had forgotten how prolific she was.  Her music was picked up by everybody from James Taylor to early Motown R&R; to The Beatles.  Her voice is better than ever (at the time of this filming), and her stage performance is unsurpassed. For a genuine superstar that's been around a while, she, in an unusually genuine way, seems to be just loving the whole experience.A wonderful recorded concert.  Recommended for about anybody.",Positive
"Carole Kings 1993 concert is a rare commodity, if you like Carole King, and, most folks do. She still had that youthful bouncey energetic verve. A nice voyage back in time to the pre 9/11 days. Kind of Halcyon. I got mine used on Amazon at a great price with fast delivery. Keep it up Amazon.",Positive
"An excellent selection for the serious follower of ballet.  Only the cream of the cropare represented here dancing some of the most exciting pas de deux on record. If you loveballet, you will love this.",Positive
"I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS DVD FOR THE EXPERIENCED VIEWER OF LIVE OR DVD PERFORMANCES OF BALLET. IT IS A COMPENDIUM MOST SUITED TO THE PERSON OF ANY AGE WHO HAS NOT BEEN MUCH EXPOSED TO CLASSIC DANCE NOR COLLECTED FULL PERFORMANCE DVD'S.YES, THE TITLE IS SOMEWHAT MISLEADING, MORE ACCURATE WOULD A SUB5ITLE SUCH AS ""SAMPLES FROM SOME OF THE LEADING BALLET COMPANIES"" OR ""A PRIMER FOR BEGINNERS IN VIEWING DANCE"".FOR THE PURPOSES I OUTLINE, MY ONLY QUARREL IS WITH THE UNEVEN LENGTHS OF THE SELECTIONS. BETTER TWO OR THREE FEWER AND MORE TIME FOR THE REMAINING ONES. AS IT IS, TWO OR THREE ARE FRUSTRATINGLY SHORT WHILE NONE OF THE OTHERS COULD BE SAID TO BE TOO LONG.HOWEVER, MARKETING GOALS PROBABLY DICTATED A MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ITEMS WITH SUFFICIENT TIME FOR MOST TO AVOID THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE ""COMING ATTRACTIONS"" OR PREVIEWS.THE VIRTUE FOR THE BEGINNER IS THAT ALL THESE SELECTIONS ARE GOOD TO LOOK AT AND GOOD TO HEAR, ALL THE PERFORMERS HIGHLY COMPETENT, AND ALL THE SEGMENTS AVAILABLE (BY SOME GROUP OF GOOD PERFORMERS) FOR PURCHASE OR RENTAL.",Positive
"This was a Christmas gift for another grandchild, a ballerina who has performed in several ballets. I hope she enjoyed it and learned from the masters.",Positive
"I am in no way an expert on ballet, but enjoy watching performances for the beauty and grace of the dancers as well as the humorous portions of some.  This is a collection of excerpts from several ballets and is delightful in and of itself.  I bought the DVD because Baryshnikov is the male lead on one track of ""Don Quixote"".  Enjoyable viewing.",Positive
"This DVD is a collection of 15 Pas de deux covering a time span of 31 years. (1965-1996). It includes such well know ballet stars as Nureyev, Baryshnikov, Makhalina, and Asylmuratova to mention a few.The entire compilation tries to focus on presenting the performers when they were in their prime. For instance the segment featuring Nureyev and Fonteyn was recorded in 1965 and although the picture is a little grainy, it is more than adequate to give us a glimpse of what these artists could do when they were at their best.Some of my favorite pieces were...- Spring Waters with Maria Bylova and Leonid Nikonov; with their fast paced,energetic leaps and lifts.- Romeo and  Juliet (balcony scene) with Alessandra Ferri and Wayne Eagling; an early example of Ferri's  acting and interpretation skills that we would continue to see develop, in the years to follow.- Swan Lake (Black Swan scene) with Julia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky; Makhalina show us (as Odile) just how poised, incredibly flexible and talented she really is in this role. She is simply stunning.-and last but not least the Don Quixote pas de deux with Cynthia Harvey and Mikhail Baryshnikov. This features some of Baryshnikov's world famous leaps and spins. Enough said!There were a couple of segments that I didn't enjoy as some of the others; but that would to be expected in a &quot;sampling&quot; of a series of pas de deux. Also a couple of dancers and choreographers were featured multiple times(3); this I found a little puzzling on a relatively short, one disc recording.An enjoyable DVD and although the video quality my change a bit from one performance to the next, you still have to feel grateful just being able to watch and appreciate some of the greatest dancers of the last century.",Positive
"The production is stark, the costumes modern, the acting dramatic and exciting, the singing for the most part is superb, the orchestral sound is incisive, sharp and compelling.  Altogether a gripping and committed performance of an old war horse.  Also great video mix of close-ups and more distant shots.",Positive
"While not the best Don Giovanni, it is certainly far from the worst.Those who enjoy lush staging and period costumes might be disappointed, but the modern setting does provide a different perspective on this classic.Juliane Banse portrays a more lively Zerlina whose joyful Mozartian entrance reminds us of why we love Mozart.  She continues to be a more active and involved peasant girl than many past Zerlinas.  Her counterpart, Masetto, sung by Roberto Scaltriti, ingenuously offers the Don a Diet Coke.  He means no offense by this--he's simply a peasant working man, innocently offering an upper-class gentleman what he would give a fellow laborer.  And this is a good illustration of the way this performance accentuates the class differences put forth in this Mozart work.This production also emphasizes the incurably evil nature of a man who exploits others for his own sick motives.  Besides living to take advantage of all women, he is not nice to men either.  He is perfectly ready to sacrifice to an angry mob, the life of his ever-loyal buddy, Leporello.Some will be more than a bit offended when ""The Don"" gropes Zerlina, or when he humps a statue of the Madonna, but these actions really help to add to the portrayal of a sick, vicious, spoiled, elite society scion--a vile man who makes an eloquent argument for capital punishment.The music and singing are more than adequate;  the acting excellent.A weak spot might be the Commendatore's rather subdued singing--we are all used to  more commanding pronouncements from this ghostly statue.Though not my favorite Don Giovanni, this presents a starkly realistic take on a womanizer who is more a truly evil individual, rather than just the usual portrayal as a playing-around fun-loving Casanova.  Brace yourself before you face this vicious Don.",Positive
"This video is excellent and superb, in music, in the accoustic and the range of shooting. The performance itself is really excellent, the singers are divine in their singing as well as performance. However, only one disappointment, that is the costumes which take the contemporary costume, which left no  imagination to us of the period of story and the background are too static. Nevertheless, I enjoy watching and listening to this video and feel very much entertained.",Positive
"Renato Bruson aces this role like no one I have see/heard so far.  He infuses humor into every scene without resorting once to silliness.  Well supported by the rest of the cast, and well photographed.",Positive
"I'm giving this title 4 stars because it's currently the only video available of this opera that I know of. Carreras is in dashing form, although his high notes generally tend to spread. Nevertheless, he makes a handsome Moorish prince--although, even he can't bring off the saccharine scene where he's supposed to be an angel in heaven singing to Giselda on earth. The other draw is Ghena Dimitrova. She performed this opera a year or so after her La Scala debut in Turandot. I thought she made a good try, but she seems miscast. And she's physically larger than Carreras, so the two of them together close up on video seem a bit much--but that over the top quality is what we all know and love opera for. If we wanted careful good taste, we'd go elsewhere. Vocally, Dimitrova dominates, of course. When she lets loose those gargantuan, bazooka high notes, everyone else is blown off the stage. She manages at quieter volumes, too. Some of the coloratura is uneasily navigated, and she's always had difficulty in the passaggio, especially at mezza voce.  And her voice goes flat sometimes, most glaringly in her big mad scene that ends Act II, where one has the uncomfortable feeling that she's pulling off the stratospheric coloratura and strenuous tessitura by sheer force of will.  But what a will!  Her high range seems only capable of two effects: soft or very loud (and frequently stridently loud) but not much in between. When I first saw this video, I kept thinking how much better suited she was to roles with lots of unsubtle screaming like Turandot or Abigaille. Giselda is perhaps more difficult: the role demands loud moments, soft, introspective moments, agility, endless legato-spinning, plus she has a big mad scene. The role is basically all over the place but amusingly so. Dimitrova is perhaps not a natural choice for Giselda--she's more of an acquired taste, but considering her natural handicap, she acquits herself ably. Oh, yeah--there are a few other singers in the cast too, but none of them seem to make much of an impression--they seem almost an afterthought.Verdi was obviously trying to reduplicate the success of Nabucco with this opera with its many scenes attempting to echo its predecessor's patriotic choruses and unsubtle political references. The story is, of course, ludicrous. But I must say that after many hearings this opera's roughhewn vitality and schizophrenic scene changes grew on me. Unlike Nabucco, it balances high decibel spectacle with intimate moments, although these generally tend toward the treacly. It's a very vigorous, thumpingly melodic kind of silliness that you either respond to or you don't. This is the kind of opera that people who don't like Italian opera generally point to to indicate their disgust. Their point is taken, but I still think they miss the boat. An opera like this doesn't appeal to one on an intellectual level; it's all visceral and heavy on the sensual appeal--vulgar, yes; boring, no. With two principals in the leads like Carreras and Dimitrova, it's definitely worth the investment, especially since it currently has no competition.",Positive
"This is yet another religious opera from Verdi's early years.  The two sides, each calling the other infidels, kill for their respective gods.  When Giselda cries (which she does several times) that god does not want blood, he wants peace, she is called sacrilegious (also several times) by the wise old holy man who carries a sword.  The scenery was non-existent, just shieldlike symbols lowered and raised from the rafters.  Carreras' voice was beautiful, though he didn't sing much.  Dimitrova who sang lots was not right for the role.  She had power and range and was soft a few times, but in the 4th act when she should have had facility, she didn't come through.  My CD of this opera has June Anderson, and I had some misgivings about hearing Dimitrova fill her shoes.  I did not like the choral music (Verdi hadn't reached his peak at this stage), but other than that the score (what I heard of it) was very beautiful, even for an early work.  I started the thing a couple nights ago, was tired and slept through the first act.  I shut it off, read the synopsis on the back of the box to see what I'd missed, and just now finished it.  Except for the conversion of Oronte, and the holy wars (that should be a contradiction in terms, and I wanted to see the Muslims win for a change), I was totally lost.  I have no idea what the story of this opera is. Just hurrah for Christianity and death to the infidels, is all I got out of it.  All the infidels.  When the wise old man (who sang beautifully) who seemed to galvanize these crusaders bit the dust at the end, I couldn't have cared less.",Positive
"But if you want thrilling early Verdi with all his flaws and with all his genius stop right here. I wonder if you could cast this opera today. Certainly not as well as this 1984 La Scala production. It is good to see Carreras, the 3rd tenor, at work. And Dhimitrova is at her straight out best. The production also deserves a word of praise. A full traditional production with real grandeur. The sound is a little thumpy but that's its age. All in all a welcome addition to the galley years of the Verdi canon.",Positive
"Early Verdi operas are making a slow comeback.  While not as stunning musically or dramatically as his later works (La Forza, Otello), they are laden with memorable wonderful melodies ""long long melodies,"" as Verdi himself put it while describing the works of Bellini.  While heavily criticized by critics for the ""um-pa-pa"" beat employed more than generously, a lot of these melodies are actually very intricate and a careful listener can spot ""Otello"" in ""Stiffelio"" and ""Falstaff"" in ""Un Giorno"".  In the 70s, conductor Lamberto Gardelli brought a lot of these works back to life, casting exciting then-new stars, such as Carreras, Ricciarelli, Sass, Domingo, Norman, and Wixell.  Today, thanks to Fabio Luisi, we can hear more of these jams, most notably the overlooked ""Jerusalem"". But on video, these early operas are terribly neglected.  Aside from a wonderful ""Simon Boccanegra"" with Milnes, I can only name a couple more notable releases that made their way to DVD.This ""I Lombardi"" with Carreras and Dimitrova is currently the only version available on video, and it is in the VHS format.  The recording, thus, has many faults.  The image is sometimes blurry and the music sounds like a mono recording.  But the voices are almost incredibly good.  The young Carreras absolutely shines as Oronte, effectively managing heroic and dramatic aspects of the role that hints at Il Trovatore.  His range extended to almost 2.5 octaves and there wasn't any noticeable break in passagio - a must for bel canto and early to mid- Verdi operas.  Thanks to Hristo Brombardov two huge operatic stars of the late 20th century literally shook down the opera stages around the world - Ghena Dimitrova and Nicolai Ghiaurov.  Dramatic soprano Ghena Dimitrova possessed possibly the largest soprano voice in opera history.  This was not a voice that could be easily recorded, let alone matched on stage.  Surprisingly, Carreras manages to do just that - the super-loud crescendos are perfectly matched by the two singers; it's actually quite amazing how a lyric tenor could do that.  The perfect Giselda, both physically and vocally, though, would be Katia Ricciarelli, Carreras's long-time partner on both ""I Lombardi"" and ""Jerusalem"".  While Dimitrova's huge voice is a wonder to admire, IMHO the role of Giselda requires more subtlety and more gentle acting than she is able to muster.  Although Act 4 duet is indeed marvelous and melting in its beauty.The supporting cast consists of singers I haven't heard of before, but they do a very good job, particularly Silvano Carroli as a character aptly named Pagano (don't you just love the names of some characters in Verdi's operas of this period?  How about a ""Luisa Miller"" villain named Wurm?).The costumes are somewhat strange and too elaborate.  I would prefer more understated design of Oronte's garbs, especially considering Carreras's dashing good looks.  The sets are actually very good, I was able to make out most of the detail despite the relatively dark and sometimes ""smudged"" picture.I hope this video soon becomes available on DVD.  Several things for the engineers to watch out besides the picture would be a) Dimitrova's voice overwhelming the chorus more than once and causing major sound disturbances, b) the subtitles appear and disappear somewhat randomly.  Performance-wise this is an opera not to miss by any means.  It's also the only one available, so don't hesitate and get it.",Positive
"This ""Fancuilla"" is a bit of a mixed bag, an old-fashioned, no frills production, conducted and directed moderately well. Neblett, singing a signature role, is a bit melodramatic at times, and hits some of her high notes by force of sheer will. A not particularly pretty sound. Domingo, on the other hand, is magnificent. Dashing in appearance, passionate and sexy, he sings gloriously throughout. The DVD's overall sound is not all that good -- it was filmed, after all, way before the digital age. That said, I'm enjoying it very much, and can see myself happily pulling it out whenever I need a comforting Puccini/Domingo fix. This is a favorite opera of mine, and I'm not at all unhappy with the purchase.",Positive
"Puccini's La Fanciulla Del West must have a great cast, in order to bring out the depth of characterizations and musical values, as prescribed by Puccini and his librettist. Placido Domingo and Carol Neblett shine in this production from the Royal Opera. The rest of the cast are all well- suited to their roles. Maestro Santi has a reputation for being a formidable Italian conductor! The production is great. I'm spoiled by today's High-Definition format, so my only reservation is the picture quality. This production is from a number of years ago. All in all,this is a good product and should be in any operaficionado's collection!",Positive
"Overall I loved this performance, especially the performances of Domingo and Neblett.  Yes, she may have been overtaxed in the role at times, but for me the chemistry between the two of them was wonderful.  He with a soft edged machismo and she as the tough woman in the wild west but with an obvious feminine side.  I found both the characters very believable.  Carolli was acceptable but not great.  Wish it had been Milnes as in the recording on the DGG CD.  The production values are good but the age of this recording shows.  It definitely does not have the sharpness of more modern recordings.  I've not seen the La Scala DVD mentioned here but I've heard it on CD and while Domingo is as good as always, I find Zampieri's voice just plain ugly.",Positive
"Fanciulla should be lively....rugged men, perky young gal.... but Neblett acts like a 40 year old school marm and is not helped by the ponderously slow tempi.  This ain't Wagner!!  Phrases that should bounce and sparkle are more like dirges.  Domingo is ordinary as usual, but sings a bit better here than in the Met production.  I usually like Carolli, but not so much here.......rather stiff and one dimensional.So why did I give 4 stars.........the sets and costumes are fantastic.  Altho Minnie's cabin has elaborate china and stuff you would never expect in a wilderness cabin.",Positive
"The best video of this opera is the Met's but this is a good second one for your collection.  I can't stand the soprano in the La Scala version and as much as I like Domingo, I can't listen to that version at all.  I recommend this and have it on VHS as well as laser.  It's not at the level of the Met's production with Milnes and Daniels, however.  That's the best on video.  Worth owning!",Positive
"Fanciulla holds a special place in my heart and is probably my favorite of Puccini's operas.  His loving, if quaint, portrait of the Wild West never fails to touch this Californian.  After all, WE romanticize our history, why shouldn't Puccini?  This charming Covent Garden production is the one I turn to for a cozy, old-fashioned treatment.  This is my fairy-tale Fanciulla and the '92 Met my verismo version- both indispensable.  And now that I've added the '91 Scala I love it, too- Domingo giving and amazing and heartbreaking performance.I freely admit that my attention tends to focus on Domingo when watching any of these.  He is so perfect for this role- probably the most interesting character Puccini wrote for tenor.  Here, in his younger days, Domingo plays Ramirrez/Johnson with plenty of bravado and an ample dose of swagger.  This newly made bandit is arrogant and impetuous but also insecure and bitterly ashamed of his occupation, such as it is.  I think he desperately wants a way out but feels trapped.  When dragged onstage in Act III, he shows the terror of the hunted and the exhaustion of his condition but it's his own miserable guilt that really weighs him down.  He vehemently protests the false accusations yet he shrinks before the threats of the mob and almost seems to feel he rather deserves what's coming.This is perhaps my favorite 3rd Act, overall.  From the lugubrious opening chords it builds steady tension- one swell rising over another as it sweeps along.  I always feel I can almost see the chase as it is narrated.  And then the wonderful Sonora (Rawnsley) bursts in with such a lusty ""E preso!"" you can be sure Johnson can look for no mercy here!  I prefer the movement of the Covent chorus, too.  There is more milling around and groups coming and going whereas at the Met they mainly march up and down the street a couple times.  And while they use no outright violence in their assault upon Johnson their menacing hatred is palpable and the whole sequence effectively chilling.  And then we come to that lovely, closing farewell that always draws a contented sigh from me.  I feel this production best captures that beautiful nostalgia for the Sierras. A nostalgia I myself feel, for they are MY Sierras, too, and I cherish memories of those `bei monti' from many a camping trip.(But the Met DVD is also excellent,Puccini - La Fanciulla del West / Daniels, Domingo, Milnes, Croft, Laciura, Fitch, Slatkin, Metropolitan Operawith Daniels, Milnes as THE definitive Sheriff, a wonderful Nick in Laciura and Domingo using his great maturity to touch the heart in that special way unique to his later years.

"This performance of Handel's great oratorio in modern setting will, and indeed has become, a classic.The reason is not hard to find, for the performance, chorus, conductor, director included, are all absolutely top-notch.William Christie has an earlier CD recording of this oratorio, a truly sterling performance it is, but this 1996 Glyndebourne live recording surpassed his own earlier recording musically.The reason are manifold, but the most obvious being that the vocal cast is 'overall' even stronger here - the best Handellians of the late 20th century are all there, soloists in all the vocal departments - soprano, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano, bass...and the chorus sings gloriously under the superb (and seasoned) direction of the great William Christie, so that musically really nothing go amiss.The controversy, if any, with this is the production's setting in modern USA. The 'President' is there (so it was in the original libretto, too). A noble woman (Theodora), a religious woman (Irene), two soldiers (Septimius and Didymus) and the 'President' (Valens) - it requires quite a bit of imagination to 'transport' the Roman setting to modern USA, but it works! The dying scene of Theodora and Didymus is the MOST effective ever seen in stage presentations of this work.The major credits are three-fold:1. Superb musical direction by Christie mentioned above;2. Terrific performance by the entire vocal cast, no single weak-link;3. Wonderful direction by Peter Sellars to virtually every single person on the stage.It is the emotional conviction of this singularly effective performance that carries the day, and despite the 'controverisal' setting, there is at the end of it nothing controversial any more.I would not say that this is the ONLY Theodora DVD to own, but it is certainly one of those performances that can withstand the passage to time.",Positive
"Not those production that you would fall in love with at first sight, but being a primarily musical work and in fact an oratorio instead of an opera, the director Peter Sellars could not be put to blame for setting up a modern version.The proper focus is of course the utterly beautifully performed music and singing, and you can see how all those involved got totally submerged into the beauty of the score - even the chorus.It is absolutely shattering to see the emotional involvement in this performance, headed by the great Lorraine Hunt, with a marvelous David Daniels, terrific Dawn Upshaw,This 1996 Glyndebourne performance really had the best of Handelian singers in the cast, right from the opening aria 'Go my faithful soldier go', the singing is simply more perfect than perfect.Apart from Hunt, Daniels and Upshaw, Croft is another tour-de-force in this terrific cast.I suggest to those viewers who took such exceptions to the setting of this production to treat the singing as being done in concert.In context, this is what this production really is. And a terrific concert performance it is that you would hardly find again.Miss this, and die.",Positive
"I have nothing to add to the reviews of those who have found this a superlative, moving 'gesamtkunstwerk'.  All four soloists are excellent, as is the orchestra and dramatic interpretation of what is, after all, an oratorio.I have just found out that Lorraine Hunt Lieberson died of cancer on July 3, 2006.  A life all too short!  Her performance in this production shows just what was lost with her passing.  This is yet another reason to obtain it and witness for yourselves.",Positive
"I'm torn.  I think the singing is absolutely riveting...everyone is terrific.  I love the set with the huge cracked bottles.  Handel's music is gorgeous, and it's gorgeously played.  So a very strong yes.But...but...it seems to me that the production has to serve the music.  I don't see how it serves the music to put the men in flying suits (if that's what they are) and to pretend that this has something to do with the American president.  Was Nixon, or whoever this was supposed to be, executing Christians?  Or Democrats, for that matter?  The concept is just so stupid and jarring, set against this wonderful music.Would someone who knows the text better than I do please tell me if in the original Valens is referred to as ""President,"" as he is several times here?  Was the original word ""Emperor"" perhaps?  If so, is it OK with the director of this production and his fans to change the words to fit this lame conception of what Handel was talking about?  [A reviewer who knows more about the subject that I do has just told me that the word ""president"" is in the original libretto....]Anyway, the production made me cringe, but the singing and playing are so beautiful that I'm giving it four stars.  Bravo to Christie and the singers, boo to this lame-o production.",Positive
"Perhaps some of the reviewers who preceded me have been too literal in their interpretations of this production.  As I see it, a rather powerful (and hypocritical) group in power is persecuting a small and rather meek group, the reigning group using religion/culture as the basis of their demands for conformity.  With a few adjustments it could be any set of cultures, Chinese government versus the Tibetans, for example.  Sellars concept is quite powerful; where he goes wrong (whether due to ego, to poor taste, or to lack of trust in the intelligence of his audience) is in gratuitous action: all that hand-waving, e.g.  The worst offense for me is in ""fly-catching"", i.e., the addition by the director of sounds or actions that distract the audience from the important part of the scene, in the case of Handel the glorious music and in the case of this production the gorgeous singing.In spite of all the nit-picking complaints I have about Sellars direction, this is a very powerful piece of theatre.  Sellars, by the way, has said that he loves it when he gets booed; that means (to him) that people are really thinking about the issues.  OK, Mr. Sellars, have your ego-boosting explanation, but this person will boo you for so much idiotic micro-managing: slurred speech in an opera to signify drunkeness!; sopranos singing while bent double over the back of a chair; characters rolling about on the floor and crying out in fear or pain while another character is singing such beautiful music, etc.  But there's just too much about this production that is splendid -- don't pass it up because of poor Peter's bad taste.",Positive
"This one rattled the purists a little. Director Peter Sellars moved the story George Frideric Handel's Oratorio Theodora from ancient Rome to modern day America and made an opera out of it. That was a bold move. An Oratorio is basically a choral concert with soloists. This is anything but. It worked though. The work is about oppression, its causes and the effect on people on both sides. The staging enhances the drama and themes are always clear.Valens' actions make his nature obvious. He's a small and vindictive shell determined to beat the world into believing he's more. The actions of Septimius and Didymus make it clear their loyalty to their nation stands in contrast with their contempt for Valens' cruelty. Theodora, Irene, and Didymus stand as people liberated by their choices. The music, the staging, and the people cast in their respective roles keep all this as clear as crystal. Frode Olsen's portrayal of the despot Valens is so concise that it was hard to rate his performance objectively. Tall, handsome and charismatic, he ends up being the perfect charlatan with no substance. His drunken tirade at the beginning of the second act is fabulous. Tenor Richard Croft excels as Septimius, the weaker willed of the two centurions. His portrayal is thought provoking to the point where it forces the viewer to question what he or she would do in a similar circumstance. Countertenor David Daniels is marvellous in the role of Didymus. His character is strong but gentle. It's something he conveys well, both with his body language and his singing. Dawn Upshaw is brilliant as Theodora. Like Didymus, her character is an example of the strongest being the most generous of spirit. Theodora is brave but though oppressed wishes harm to none. Dawn Upshaw has an inherently gentle quality in her voice. It suits this character well. She's a terrific actress as well, one who appears to feel everything she conveys. The one who stands above everyone else however is Lorraine Hunt. This lady is phenomenal. Her voice is full and strong in all ranges. Her 'mezzo' notes are deep and broad. Her high notes soar across the heavens. Her passion is magnificent. She lives every note she sings. Her performance here stands as one of the best I've seen in any genre. If her performance of ""To Thee"" at the beginning of Act III doesn't melt and rend your heart you haven't got one.Handel was proud of this work.  He felt it was his best. This performance of it makes a strong case for that sentiment. William Christie's tempi combine the best elements of the grace and strength in the music. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gives all that could be asked and more. Their playing is impeccable. The singing, as stated already, is fabulous.The only complaint with this DVD lies with its chapter breakdowns. The menu is limited. Scenes rather than individual numbers divide the work. There's also only one audio track. These are small complaints though. The odd chapter divisions are a small price to pay for this performance. The audio track (two channel Dolby) is exceptional. Everything is crystal clear. This truly is the next best thing to seeing it live.I first ran into ""Theodora"" about a dozen years ago. Like many I knew ""Messiah"" and some of the other favourites but knew nothing of the piece. An ad about a complete recording with a notation about this being Handel's ""favourite of his works"" caught my eye and after that a little voice wouldn't quit. It was the McGegan recording (which also featured Lorraine Hunt, that time as Theodora) and I bought it without having heard a note. It was a good decision. The beauty of this music is indescribable. Handel must have put every good idea he had and all his effort into it. ""Messiah"" may be the most famous (and that fame isn't unwarranted), but, for the best from Handel, this may be the place to go.",Positive
"If you're looking for grand opera with pagentry and costumes showcased in period sets, this production is not for you.  If you're looking for some of the finest singing in opera heaven, this DVD is for you.  I'm in total disagreement with Sellers production concept, but those voices take control over everything so you can just close your eyes, or better yet, turn off the picture on your tv set and enjoy these opera voices at their finest.",Positive
"Handel, when asked towards the end of his life what he thought his greatest work was, replied ""Theodora"". It's his next-to-last oratorio, and it is of such transcendant beauty that words fail to describe it. Everything that can be said about this performance has already been said better by others, so I won't even try. Peter Sellar's direction may not be to everyone's taste, but he had the vision to turn this English ""Oratorio"" into a viable stage piece, crucially giving Lorraine Hunt the opportunity to give her greatest dramatic performance. She's the star of this show, even if everyone else surpasses themselves as well. A sublime, overwhelming recording of Handel's greatest work. Not to be missed.",Positive
"If you are fortunate enough to buy this DVD, you will see that Peter Sellars certainly lives up to his reputation as an avant-garde innovator. Certainly it can be a gamble to invest in his visions. However, there is no such risk with his 1996 staging of Handel's ""Theodora"". Not only does he not disappoint, he creates an intensely creative and heartfelt modern-day update of what has to be one of the saddest stories about the power of faith in a world of bad governments. Now eight years have elapsed since this staging, and the theme resonates more than ever.The minimalist set acts as a subtle counterpoint to an astonishing cast. Really impressive is Lorraine Hunt, who sings in that burnished mezzo-soprano range that fits her role so well. What I appreciated most about her performance is that she got the drama of what was essentially an observational role without calling undue attention to her character. When you have five great voices competing for your attention, obviously that is not a minor accomplishment.  The real standout, however, is David Daniels. The countertenor voice is an acquired taste for many, but his full and rich voice will convert even the most jaded. He brings a melting, haunting quality to his performance from his first outstanding aria to the final heartbreaking ending where Sellars uses an almost clinical approach to the inevitable. It was obviously a star-making performance for Daniels, and he completely delivers the goods. The results are devastating.If you are a non-opera buff...if you are leery of stories with heavy Christian themes...if you are afraid of the 207-minute running time, fear not, as this is no depressing, fundamentalist history lesson marathon...they even sing in English!  This is an amazing piece that has to be experienced. As for the DVD itself, the picture quality is crisp and clean, and the sound quality nice and deep. An excellent job and well worth the investment even if you already own the VHS tape.",Positive
"Browsing for something else, I noticed that this excellent DVD is available cheap in used copies! Buy it! Don't wait!Theodora was not composed as an opera. Interestingly, Bill Christie's operatic staging of it is not only modern in costuming and sets, but remarkably more ""modern"" musically than the operas in Italian which Handel composed earlier in his career. I imagine that people who automatically hate ""modern-dress"" productions will hate this performance passionately. I suspect that ardent Christians will also dislike it, since it completely submerges the Christian themes of martyrdom and faith in a portrayal of resistance to tyranny and intolerance of any sort. The satiric elements of the staging were certainly not part of Mr. Handel's conception, but they work spectacularly as theater. The fact that the despotic and vain Emperor Valens looks and moves exactly like Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California, has to be purely coincidental, given the date of production, but it adds greatly to the fun.Christie's period instrument orchestra responds to his direction with delicacy and precision. Countertenor David Daniels finds his perfect role as Didymus, and sings heroically. Bass Frode Olsen is despicable as Valens, and in the meantime sings superbly too. Dawn Upshaw is perhaps a bit out of her natural repertoire, but acquits herself well anyway. The unlikely (some might say ungodly) combo of meticulously historical musical performance with outrageously anachronistic modern stagings, for me, works better with Handel than it does with Mozart or later composers. In this case, it works very well.",Positive
"Peter Sellars sets the production in (around) the present and while several things maynot make literal sense (e.g., an American president condemning a virtuous Christian woman to a sentence of prostitution at the Temple of Venus for not worshiping Roman gods), the contemporary setting for the most part is powerfully effective.Save for carry on props (chairs, etc.) the only ""set"" is an ever changing setting of enormous stressed antique Roman tear bottles.  Profoundly simple and beautifully capturing the feel of the ""ancient"" in this updated setting.Frode Olsen's President Valens opens the work declaring that his gods are to be worshiped and his happy followers (each carrying an American soft drink, which I thought to be a minor unfortunate directorial choice) rouse and begin the first of the big hand gestures which will occur throughout the rest of the night.  For once Sellars' use of hand gestures not only appropriate but excitingly useful.  Olsen's rather large voice was exciting and reminded me a little of Triegle's turn as Giulio Cesare.As two of the president's main guards, David Daniels (Didymus) and Richard Croft (Septimius) are magnificent.  While much is written about Daniels, I have for years been amazed by the sheer beauty of Richard Croft's voice.  I have always been a fan, and his singing here evoked beautiful memories of a Semele a few years back where his ""Where 'er you walk"" won the prize for the most beautiful singing I've experienced live.It is nearly impossible to separate Sellars direction of ""Theodora"" from the vocal performances - there is so much going on, indeed, the entire work achieves a nearly balletic performance.  I would imagine it, in our era especially, to strip sexuality from a stage work, to be extremely difficult.  Sellars, early on, establishes same sex bonding, first between Didymus & Septimius, later Theodora and Irene with such beauty, gentleness and honesty that later, when men and women are touching it is neverperceived as sexual - rather compassion.One of the most beautiful of images occurs during Septimius' aria ""Descend kind pity, heavenly guest.""  Sellars has created a pas de deux between the two soldiers Croft alone singing, imploring heaven's pity. At the downward scale sung on the word ""descend"" Didymus' arms repeat a falling motion finally encircling Septimius.  When Septimius faces up and sees his fellow soldier he is startled, profoundly touched, wiping tears from his eyes. We witness a bonding deeper than either foreshadowing the compassion and highlighting the similarities between these two different men. It doesn't hurt that Croft sings with the most ravishing tone one is likely to ever encounter in this role.Late his bravura aria ""Dread the fruits of Christian folly"" lets him sing what may be the fastest coloratura I've heard a tenor execute.  His performance, as well as Lorraine Hunt Lieberson are the highlights of this extraordinarily beautiful evening.Of Ms. Hunt, all I can ask is: has there EVER been a better singer of this type of music?  Her Irene is simply an overwhelmingly powerful presence. Sellars has cast Irene as the leader of the Christian sect to which Theodora belongs.  She is obviously and  passionately devoted to her congregation and it is clear this community would follow her to the ends of the world.  Irene has some of the best music in ""Theodora"" and Hunt singsit with such passion and aching beauty, nowhere (for me)more than in ""As with rosey steps the morn.  This is one of Handel's most exquisitely beautiful arias and Hunt's singing of this is simply ravishing.  She is up to big coloratura work in ""Bain of Virtues"" and her ornamentation in the di capo is thrilling stuff.Dawn Upshaw's Theodora is one of the best things she's ever done.  The image of her, in simple white, rising from her chair at what looks like a prayer meeting is a stunning image as she begins her aria ""Fond flattering world adieu.""  Her voice was built for this type of slow Handel aria.  Sellars gives her some of the grandest arm/hand gestures ofthe cast and Upshaw's execution of them was believable - never once looking artificial, rather as if merely another extension of the music.  ""Angels ever bright and fair"" provides another stunning visual moment - when Septimius, with his soldiers, reluctantly but dutifully leads her away to ""that vile place.""  The arresting image of Theodora in virginal white, and the soldiers in their orange riot gear is hard to forget.The prison scene, a darkened stage with a large yellow square representing her cell finds Theodora in a red bathrobe over a white slip. Upshaw's movements become Martha Grahams all tortured angles and match the coloring of her singing.  Foregoing her typical pure sound Upshaw is unafraid to emit painful, frightened sobs and frenzied hyperventilating, unifying physical and vocal performance into a dramatic whole.  The image of her on the floor, palms and feet extending upward, robe barely wrapped around her magnificently projects the image of a renaissance saint ascending to heaven.William Christie and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and the Glyndebourne chorus are completely ""on"" throughout the entire performance.  I cannot recommend this videotape highly enough.  What lucky audiences Glyndebourne had for this magical production. A wonderful achievement by all involved.",Positive
"It was only after I watch Christie's Rodelinda dvd that I was able to understand how sublime is this Theodora.Not only because Handel wrote such a superior,touching music.Moreover,this performance has a higher emotional level that puts itself on the handelian elite recordings ever.In despite I have some restriction to Upshaw' singing,it's impossible to discard this dvd;both Frode Olsen and Lorraine Hunt are in luxuriant voices,Daniels has the best countertenor vocal equipment presently(listen the way he starts ""Streams of Pleasure ever flowing""!)and,just watch yourselves this kind of a miracle,tenor Richard Croft singing ""From Virtue springs"" on third act and go right to Paradise.Even Olsen,the vilain on the block,seems touched by.Bravissimo,Mr. Croft!By one's turn,Christie can't disguise his passion with this music and Sellars proofs himself a very update director;politic-religious tricks on America setting is clever and very suitable nowadays.I don't like this cho-(I)-reography counfounding singers in their singing,however this is appropriate to fanaticism of characters like Irene.Very good sound recording and image;a memorable revival of the Handel's favorite oratorio.",Positive
"This was an eye-opener for me. I've known Theodora for many years and was aware of the fact that Handel thought it was one of his best works. When I sat down to watch this (on regular DVD the first time round), I was blown away with the intensity of everyone involved. The Orchestra of the Enlightenment under William Christie play immaculately. The singers are a class by themselves. David Daniels' beautiful countertenor is used to maximum effect and his involvement is total. So is Dawn Upshaw's performance a tour de force. Lorraine Hunt Lieberson gives us a portrayal that will leave you breathless. The staging is thankfully as unobtrusive as possible and did not annoy. I could have done without the silly arm and finger movements but you get used to it fast enough. In the original revue one critic wrote: &#34;the audience sat as if stunned&#34;. Another reviewer was not too pleased with the fact that all the principals involved but one, as well as the conductor, were  American. And that on British soil! I have never seen an opera production (although this is not an opera) that has satisfied so much over a long time. The new Blu-Ray DVD is of much better picture quality, while the sound is first-rate. Get it while you can.",Positive
"Notes accompanying the McCreesh/Gabrieli Consort CD of Theodora point to indications that Handel considered this oratorio his finest work in opera or oratorio. That is certainly my experience with it, and this DVD of this Sellars/Christie operatic staging of the oratorio is my favorite presentation of it, one I go back to again and again. As one would expect with Christie, the orchestration is all one could ask for and is matched by the quality of the singing. Sellars' modernist, minimalist staging works seamlessly to enhance the drama of the storyline. And to my surprise, the Sellars USAF/contemporary dress costuming works exceptionally well (except for the scenes where over-the-top pressure control gear is added to the USAF flight suits for the Roman troops--I can only think that the extra gear came as a package deal with the flight suits and Sellars couldn't bear not using it).To fully appreciate the all round quality of this production, just compare it with the DVD for the Bejun Mehta interpretation of Theodora.",Positive
"All the reviews I read about this Opera DVD were right - this is a superb DVD in every respect.  I had not heard or seen this opera before and consider this a real gem. There are arias in here that are completely sublime and sung with such meaning and depth by Upshaw and Hunt that they transported me to another realm.  David Daniels is marvelous - one of his first major roles and a foretaste of what was to come as his voice matured.  There are many songs sung by the chorus and they are wonderful musically, and Sellers has choreographed them in a stylized and meaningful way. All in all a fabulous production - no weak singers or actors, and powerful in its modern setting. Buy it!!",Positive
"Handel's late oratorio is giving a magnificent reading in this modern staging, taped at the 1996 Glyndebourne Festival.  Baroque specialist William Christie leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and a group of spectacularly talented principals who bring great sensitivity and drama to some of Handel's most achingly-beautiful music.  Daniels, Upshaw, Croft and Hunt all sing ravishingly (pay special attention to Croft's wonderful first act aria).  The Glyndebourne Chorus is spectacular, and gives wonderful treatment to the great choral sections.  Avante-garde director Peter Sellars gives the piece a modern treatment that holds interest, if not providing any revelatory moments.  Technical aspects are superb.  Highly recommended for the Handel completist, and a great introduction to this beautiful score (considered to be Handel's personal favorite).",Positive
"There are several excellent performances of Handel operas on DVD - the Copenhagen Giulio Cesare and Partenope, the Glynebourne Giulio Cesare, the Christie performance of Rodelina, the Alcina with Catherine Nagelstad - but this, a performance of Handel's next to last oratorio, is the greatest.  It is one of the great works on DVD - to cut to the chase, buy it, buy it, buy it.Musically, it is superb;no performance, neither singers, nor chorus, nor conductor, nor orthestra is less than excellent.  Two of the performances are better than that-- Dawn Upshaw in the title role, and Lorraine Hunt Lieberson as Irene.  Both sing gloriously; both act the drama wonderfully.  I could be happy just watching their faces, so full of character and meaning and beauty are they.Let me rant a bit about Lieberson, she deserves it.  Her performance embodies a moral beauty, a virtue, I have otherwise seen only in Dame Janet Baker's performance of Orfeo; it is one of the great performances of anything: she has great lyric line, sings beautifully, acts beautiful, and in her ecstatic moments has a face I would like to gaze on while dying.Much credit, of course, must be given the director, Peter Sellars.  His staging, while a bit fussy in the first Roman scene, is acutely sensitive to each moment of the drama, and often achieves great intensity and/or beauty.  In particular, his staging of the Christian scenes marvelously dramatizes the movement of the holy spirit through human beings striving to fulfill their understanding of the will of God.A brief word about Handel's music here.  This was his favorite among his oratorios.  It is a work of surpassing lyricism, great tunes, and thrilling drama - musically, it is at LEAST as good as The Messiah.",Positive
"The opera Theodora (1750) by Georg Friedrich H&auml;ndel has the most sad end that I have seen in a haendelian opera. The story of a holy love between two persons isn`t so common in the operas. In this case, it deals with the soldier Dydimus and Theodora, the young woman that represents all the power that the faith in God can yield in a person. Dawn Upshaw as Theodora sounds wonderful. For me she represents the best role made by a woman that I have seen in a opera composed by H&auml;ndel; her aria Fond, flatt`ring world, adieu (first act) is very moving. The countertenor David Daniels as Dydimus makes an outstanding role; his aria The rapture`d soul defies the sword in the first act is powerful; he squints a little and this deed yields a special effect to hear him; besides his duet with Upshaw Streams of pleasure ever flowing (third act) is superb: the best duet I have heard in a haendelian opera. Frode Olsen as Valens makes the best role in this opera: his character`s wickedness is almost natural; his aria Racks, gibbets, sword and fire (first act) is powerful. Richard Croft as Septimius is excellent; his aria Descend, Kind pity, Heavenly Guest (first act) is beauty and you feel almost in the heaven. Lorraine Hunt as Irene is superb, too. The final chorus O love divine, thou source of fame almost made me weep: a sad, but beauty final. This performance conducted by William Christie is superb. One of the best operas that I have. I recommend this DVD set.",Positive
"This is a far better interpretation than the older Bolshoi performance that was recorded in the 1970s on murky Russian film stock.  The choreography and dancing in that version were dull to say the very least - cinematography and editing uninspired and choppy, respectively. It was also half an hour shorter than this performance.This newer version with the Australian Ballet is superbly choreographed and strongly danced.  It is perhaps the most virile ballet performance every captured on film or videotape. This is a videotaped performance and is overwhelmingly powerful and passionate.  The male dancers are all quite strikingly handsome and every movement is devoid of the ""elegance"" and effeminacy in the earlier Bolshoi performance.  This is rugged, but in its sheer masculinity, it is a tribute to the beauty of the male body in movement.This screams to be converted to DVD before the VHS goes out of print.",Positive
"Children and adults alike will enjoy this delightful ballet.  When the dolls come to life, it is a fun time in the doll makers workshop!  The dancing is wonderful and the emotions shown by the dancers are real and true.  It is a fun ballet for the whole family, and the music is beautiful.",Positive
"This production of Coppelia is very well performed in a traditional and classic style. For the most part, the dancing is outstanding, especially the lead dancers. It is a worthy addition to any ballet lover's collection. The costumes are very decorative and the sets are rustic with an old Eastern European charm. Why four stars instead of five? It's because the Kirov (1993) version has several important qualities missing or underrepresented in the Australian version. First, Coppelia, the mechanical doll, is much more animated and charming in the Kirov version. The choreographer, Oleg Vinogradov, wisely chose to give her more character and attention. After all, the ballet is named after her. In the Australian rendition, she is strictly a mechanism, with very brief appearances. You wonder why Franz and his friends ever fell for her. Second, the Kirov version creates much more interaction and support between the lead dancers and the corps. This helps to unify the two elements and accents the rift between Swanilda and Franz, especially in the final scene. In the Australian rendition, the corps and the lead dancers are much more separated, and the corps is often seen standing passively in the shadows like members of an audience. Finally, Vinogradov has wisely added comic gestures throughout the ballet, including a delightful and humorous dance involving Coppelia and Franz's friends. This is very fitting because Coppelia is probably the most famous comic ballet in the repertory. (Incidentally, in E.T.A. Hoffmann's famous tale and Offenbach's opera, Coppelia could utter friendly sighs and dance.) The Australian rendition tends to focus on elegant and classic poses--beautiful but somewhat sugary at times and not contributing much to the story.One review of the Kirov version has appropriately commented that the Australian production is more traditional and classic. This is true to a large extent. However, Coppelia lends itself to new choreography due, in large part, to its intrinsic comic element. The late George Balanchine added a considerable amount of new choreography to Coppelia, especially in the final act. This same review has added a few comments that should probably be taken with a grain of wheat. Yes, the Mazurka is missing from the first act because Vinogradov thought it was more appropriate to include it in the final scene as one of the festive dances in the town celebration. Yes, the Kirov left out the shaking of the wheat (a test for faithfulness) probably because the sets and costumes are more contemporary. (There's a very charming shaking of the wheat in the Paris version, 2001.) And what about the strange accusation that the second act of the Kirov version is grotesque? In the Australian version, we see a menacing figure carrying a severed head, a writhing bandaged body, and Franz placed on a wheel rack--enough said? (Incidentally, these scenes are not mentioned in the ""traditional"" story.) They might have frightened Hoffmann and Delibes. After all, Dr. Coppelius was meant to be eccentric but not necessarily malevolent. Finally, this same review concludes that the Kirov version is for people who hate ballet. Needless to say, this comment is not worth one grain of wheat--not to mention the chaff.",Positive
"This was my first time seeing anying by the Australian Ballet and I was very impressed.  Costumes and sets are beautiful.  Pavane and Horsman are very talented performers.  I really enjoyed the second act in the Dr's ""workroom"".  The members of the company who ""dance"" the various ""dolls"" are great especially the one who performs the floppy, unformed, unsculpted ""doll"".  Also worth noting is that a friend who knows nothing about ballet easily understood the story without help from me or any other source.",Positive
"Enough excellent and learned reviews have already been published, so all I have to say it that I agree with those reviews. I have watched this DVD several times now, and enjoyed every time.  I recommend it highly.",Positive
"It is almost twenty years (1993) since this recording of Coppelia was issued from the Australian Ballet. In all that time it still is, in my mind, the best rendering of this classic 1870 ballet by Leo Delibes. It was also in 1993 that what I consider the best runner up recording was made: that of the Kirov with new choreography by Oleg Vinogradov. Of the original choreography by Saint-Leon little remains, most danced today is the 1884 version by Petipa, Ivanov and Cecchetti. This is considered the standard classical presentation. This version was the basis of the Australian company's effort as reproduced by Peggy van Praagh with some additional choreography by her. It is a nice happy, short (thin) story with happy peasants, sunshine, flowers and lots of happy dances (even a Hungarian Czardas). It concerns a doll-maker that makes a doll so life-like that it causes trouble for a pair of innocent young lovers. After lots of dancing and dedicating a church bell it all ends happily. What I liked particularly is the limited story with a really excellent musical score by Delibes who later wrote another great score for the ballet Sylvia. He is considered along with Tchaikovsky to have defined ""classic ballet"".The performance recorded here is ""spot on"" in all ways. The stars Lisa Pavone and Greg Horsman work so well together (they are married) and each is a master technician as soloist so that watching them is always a thrill even after many viewings. The corps works very well and the Dr. Coppelius of Colin Peasley is delightful. I felt that the whole Australian presentation was ""just right"" , just enough in scenery, costumes and gimmicks for a pleasant evening's entertainment.The runner-up in productions of Coppelia is the Kirov version of 1993. It too was an excellent produciton with outstanding corps work and great stars ;Irina Shapchits (very funny) and Mikhail Zavialov. In order to stand out from all the other productions of Coppelia (and I've seen a dozen or so) M. Vinogradov resorted to somewhat excessive scenery, some added comic dances bordering on slapstick and his choreography had movements I felt were inappropriate for ""classical ballet"". However each and every movement and each and every gimmick was well done so that it was worth watching. It was too much and I felt spoiled this simple beautiful story.",Positive
Put the DVD in your medicine cabinet and watch it when you are not feeling well.  It is guaranteed to lift your spirits.,Positive
"This is, by far, one of the happier ballets in the repertoire. There's no hint of Swan Lake's or Giselle's or what-have-you's gloom and doom, and the immensely capable dancers of the Australian Ballet Company will have you smiling--and, perhaps, dancing--almost regardless of the circumstances beyond your screen. Most of the music is immediately likeable, ultimately loveable, and performed with the utmost panache. Both the (VHS) video and audio quality are quite good, too--at least for KULTUR (which seems, based on other tapes I own, to have grossly inconsistent production standards). Alas, the unbridled gaiety of the ballet is slightly marred by a few absurd characters (a ""village idiot"", for one, and a ""grandmother"", for two, both of whom tend to wear a bit thin on repeated viewings), and by some elements of slapstick comedy. But overall, this is an enormously HAPPY work of art--geared to those who are, or wish to be, in a similar state.",Positive
"Coppelia has always been my favorite ballet (to watch and to dance).My friend and I decided that we wanted to see the ballet again, after several years of not seeing it, so I went on Amazon to see what was out there.  I'm really glad that I chose the Australian Ballet's version.If you read the other reviews, yes, there are some differences from the 'classic' version of the story, but it's done really well and the dancing is phenomenal.  If you're looking for a great version of this ballet for your collection, pick this one up, you won't be disappointed.(this, from a professional ballet dancer. Well, 2 if you count the friend I watched it with!)  :-)",Positive
"It was the Australian Ballet that got me interested in this so very beautiful art form. I purchased a three ballet boxed set of Tchaikovsky ballets, which included ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Swan Lake"", and ""The Nutcracker"". I fell in love with Sleeping Beauty, by THE AUSTRALIAN BALLET.Sleeping Beauty  / Christine Walsh, Australian BalletIt stars Christine Walsh and David Ashmole. Since then I have been collecting all the ballet DVDs I can afford.Little did I know that in the ""Sleeping Beauty"" was the up and coming sensation of ""Coppelia"", Lisa Pavane and Greg Horsman. If you have that DVD, Lisa is the Fairy Godmother in the brown tutu. I could not identify Greg.I know my job as a reviewer is to inform you of what I think of ""Coppelia"" by the Australian Ballet, so I will get to the point. First of all, it is the most FUN ballet in existence. It is the happiest ballet that I have so far seen. I saw it live once many years ago in Nashville, Tennessee, so I knew the story and LOVED the music. One reviewer commenting on ""Snow White"" with music composed and conducted by Emilio Aragon from Spain, said that Aragon's music had only one theme and was repeated over and over throughout the entire ballet.Arag&oacute;n: Snow White (ballet)I did not agree (read my review on Snow White). The same could never be said about Coppelia because Leo Delibes gives us at least 31 distinctly different melodies, and most of them are so beautiful that words cannot describe them. The producers of this Coppelia were not happy with 31 melodies so they borrowed one from another Delibes ballet ""Sylvia"". The melody is the one used by the bridesmaids and groomsmen in their dance to honor the bride and groom Swanilda and Frans in the third act. It is so beautiful I do not blame them for adding it to Coppelia.Delibes: SylviaLisa Pavane is a sensational ballerina and her partner Greg Horsman is a sensational danseure. They both have a tremendous amount of dancing to do in this ballet, and most of it is fast tempo. It shows in the curtain calls as they are perspiring profusely. The costumes used in this ballet are fabulous (as they were in the Australian version of Sleeping Beauty) And the sets were also the best I've seen both live and in the Royal Ballet production of Coppelia. Each act has a completely different set. The Coppelius workshop set puts the Royal Ballet's to shame. There is simply no comparison, and that goes for the animatons (dolls) too. You don't have to believe me, just buy this ballet and listen to the patrons of the Sydney Opera House go wild when the dolls come to life and go through their dance routines, especially the disjointed rag-doll. Colin Peasley is simply great as DR. Coppelius, the ""mad"" doll maker. Peasley is also a member of the governing body of the Australian Ballet Company.When I saw this ballet live so many years ago in Nashville, the promoters offered anyone who was not happy with the production, their money back.  I did NOT ask for my money back. If you buy this ballet, I don't believe you will ask for your money back either.",Positive
"The Australia Ballet version of Coppelia is outstanding.  I especially enjoyed the animation of the corps de ballet. The production is lavish, the dancers exquisite.If you love Coppelia, don't miss the version with Fernando Bujones and the Ballet Nacional de Puerto Rico.  Yes, the production values are a bit high school, but what it lacks in expensive costuming and scenery, it more than makes up for in the sheer exuberance of the dancing.",Positive
"M, 1931 filmThe film begins with children playing a counting game in the country that gave us Grimm's Fairy Tales. [You know the origin of ""Ring around a Rosy""?] We see the furnishings in an apartment. A stranger approaches Elsie Beckman on the street. Newsboys sell an Extra edition. Eight children were killed already! Who is the murderer? Suspicions arise among friends. They print a copy of the killer's letter. [Recognize the handwriting?] The police compare the fingerprints, a graphologist studies the writing to decipher the personality of the writer. Clues are found at the murder scene. The people are terrorized by an unknown murderer. The witnesses give conflicting testimony. A red or green hat? The police search everywhere for clues. They raid the hangouts of criminals and check their papers. This is bad for their business, it keeps customer away.Three men wait for a meeting. Schranker is the best crook between Berlin and San Francisco. The heads of the gangs must do something about this situation. They must eliminate the child murderer. The police plan their strategy too. Can the public help with valid clues? The problem in these crimes is the lack of any prior connection between the victim and the murderer. [Still true for serial murderers.] This murderer leaves no clues. The police decide the murderer must have a record somewhere, they just have to search for a ""harmless man"" who has this personality. The gang leaders decide to watch the children. The beggars can do it, they are always on the streets. The police go through all the records of those released in the last five years. A man from ""Finanz Amt"" calls on Herr Beckert, but he just went out. We see Beckert on the street. He whistles a tune. He smokes ""Ariston"" cigarettes.A blind man hears someone whistling a tune and remembers something. He calls Heinrich to warn him and tell him to follow this man. Heinrich cleverly puts a mark on his shoulder! It is discovered by the little girl. Men follow him, but he disappears. The police wait in the empty apartment. The gang leaders have a plan: they will search the building themselves. One man hears a noise in the attic. They find Beckert. The alarm goes off, the gangsters flee. One man is left behind; he is ""innocent"" and knows nothing. Why did they search the entire building from the coal cellar to the storage attic? Franz talks: ""Die Kinder M&ouml;rder"".The gangs are at an abandoned brewery building. The blind man identifies Beckert. The crowd calls for death. Then they laugh at him. Beckert says he has no choice over what he does. The voices in his head tell him to kill. A compulsive murderer must be snuffed out like a candle. Does this compulsion absolve him of the murders? The jury says no. But the authorities arrive to stop the people from carrying out a lynching. Next we see a court passing judgment. This won't bring the children back. A mother says we should keep a closer watch on the children. [The story ends here, was something eliminated like the trial and condemnation? I think about 5-10 minutes of scenes were deleted.]This film is in German with English subtitles. It shows life in a German city (Berlin?) around 1931. There is no mention of the Great Depression that hit Germany the hardest, or the political turmoil that would lead to a Second World War. This story is unlike any film in 1930s America. Wasn't this film based on a true crime? 'The Changeling' is another drama on this subject.",Positive
"This was basically a superior movie, still daring in its subject matter and approach going on 70 years later. There are parts in the middle that are just a bit too wordy, however. Sorry, I wasn't looking for a car chase, but I do feel there's a bit of drag about 2/3 of the way through. The movie as a whole more than makes up for it. Was that the worst I could say? Definitely deserves its place in the noir pantheon.",Positive
"From the elongated opening scene of ""M"", you know you are in for more than a simple film could ever imagine.  The elongated lunch scene as a mother waits for her daughter to return, as we, audience members watch the daughter stray from her journey home with a stranger with a sharpened whistle.  It is foreboding, it is depressing, it is mesmerizing.  It has been a very long time since a film, especially one made 78 years ago, seemed so delicate, so thought provoking, so timeless as ""M"" does.  From these opening shots, Lang let's us know that this isn't going to be your happy utopia where criminals are caught the next day by the police and our world goes back to liquorish and lollipops, but instead a world where the locals collect like a mob and trust is thrown violently out of the window.  With excellent cinematography and a strong balance between humor and honesty, Lang creates this visceral world where the line between truth and justice get blurred, where good and evil are similar, and a man defines his actions as ""uncontrollable"".  This merely scratches the surface of ""M"", a masterful film that ranks amongst the best this world has offered.What makes ""M"" shoot ahead of anything modern, anything by cult directors, anything close to popular?  It begins with the actors, goes to the man behind the camera, and finally the skillful craftsmanship of the story.  Each of these elements never lack, never fall behind, and constantly build upon each other until that final breath that encourages you to repetitively rewatch.  To begin, Peter Lorre.  How could you not talk about ""M"" without mentioning this doe-eyed murderer.  From the beginning, we know his role in this film, yet Lang pulls every emotion out of us as we follow his route.  We feel sympathy for Lorre when he is tried, we feel scared when he is trapped in the attic, we feel hatred when he voyeuristically looks at the children - and yet, he isn't the only character in this film.  Lang introduces us to other well placed personas throughout.  The infamous Inspector Lohmann (not to mention that great floor-up shot) is the perfect example of Lang's impressions on the local German police.  The fact that Lohmann whistles, counter productive to what Lorre represents, only solidifies that idea.  To add to these already dynamic people, we have the background criminals that decide to take the matter into their own hands in hopes to eliminate the looming police presence.  The ""Safecracker"" is idealistic of what Germany was to become, the classic SS look, with the idea of eliminating the opportunity to be tried in a true court of law.  Each one of these characters provide humor, excitement, and full-blown emotion to the screen, adding to the overall impact to this film.With Lorre already bedazzling us with his range and taut emotion, it is up to Fritz Lang himself to ensure that edits, angles, and direction doesn't hinder the power of his actors.  Lang steps up to the plate and delivers with his avant-garde film making.  I use the words avant-garde because the techniques used in this film are far beyond 1931.  Lang incorporates powerful close-ups, amazing track following, and shots nearly unseen at this time.  The overhead shots, the ability to make the crowds look ravenous, the camera puns adds just as much as another lead would.  If you were impressed by his ability in ""Metropolis"", ""M"" is only going to solidify that idea of Lang.  A favorite is the raid on the office complex by a group of criminals.  Every shot, every detail is directed with ease, but complexity.  It is easy to be in awe of this film, but to take the time to see Lang's ability behind the camera will take ""M"" to a whole new level.  Personally, it is my belief, that he announces himself with this film.  A pioneer of the camera, a grandfather of what cinema is today - one cannot watch anything released today and not see Lang's influences.  See Fincher's ""Zodiac"", a nearly identical film in themes to what Lang was trying to produce here.Finally, we have acting and direction, but one must also credit the story for being not just creative and unflinchingly original, but for supporting a strong message.  The idea of being more careful was impressive to watch due to the time being 1931, a time well thought of that children could be anywhere without any worry.  The story brings evil into an American thought that good guys always prevail, that suburbia is always safe, and that the police actually do keep the streets safe.  The story of ""M"" challenges you as a viewer even today, one could argue even more so today than in 1931.  With crimes continually on the rise in this country, with the idea that pleading insanity cures the disease of murder (or is an easy innocence) the idea of ""M"", especially that final dialogue seems more important today.  The fascination also arises with the concept of the mob within this story - the horror that simple events, kindness even, could turn on anyone in a moment of panic.  Police arresting anyone that even looks at children in a peculiar way - a fascinating concept that Lang is not afraid to develop.  Imagine if this film were made two years later, what a different theme Lang would have tackled.To conclude, I loved, perhaps loved is a soft word, I worship this film.  It is intensely powerful and timelessly accurate for a 78-year old film.  I cannot wait to watch it again - not only to bath in Lang's glory, but to really see if the ""true"" killer was caught.  There is plenty left unknown, and I just want to ensure that points connect.  This is a slice of cinema that could be watched again and again, knowing that something new would be encountered each time.  A deeply enticing film, Fritz Lang proves that he was a ground breaker in his field.  Not only could he handle Science Fiction, but nearly every other genre imaginable.  ""M"" is no exception to his skill.  If you have not seen this film, watch it - experience it - know what it means to be marked like Lorre.Grade: ***** out of *****",Positive
"""M"" has everything you could hope in a great film. The acting by Peter Lorre, Gustaf Gr&uuml;ndgens, Otto Wernicke, and the rest of the cast all perfectly convey the different personalities in this complex story.  The use of black &amp; white and shadows is very moody and haunting. The use of sound is very important since it will tell you things the camera isn't showing. The camera work itself is amazing. I especially love the long shot in the beginning of the scene of the beggars are signing up to watch the streets where the camera moves back and forth, up and into a room through a window without a cut.""M"" offers so much for the viewer -- thrills, suspense, humor, terror! I enjoy it more and more with every repeated viewing. Fritz Lang does more than just give ideas on insane criminals. He compares and contrasts the police and the underworld criminal systems. You learn about the &quot;state-of-the-art &quot; systems of that time. And the last words harken a most important message that unfortunately is still true today. Also, if you look deeper, you can even sense Lang's anti-Nazi sentiments.It's a Criterion Collection DVD, so I had high expectations. I was disappointed with a lack of extras, but I happily noticed scenes that weren't on my VHS version. The picture was mostly clear with white lines rarely popping up. There were long passages of no sound at times, but it's possible it's supposed to be like that. (I no longer have my VHS version to compare.) The subtitles were clear and easy to read. There's interesting details on the film in the liner notes. And not like this would influence anyone's buying decisions, but I also loved the design on the case and the disc.",Positive
"Filmed in 1931 this is the first serial killer movie...M is the story of a serial killer who terrorizes a German town. As you follow the story you get to see the city going mad, the hunt for the killer, the killer at work and then eventually Lorre fleeing for his life.. Before the killer strikes hes always whistling this haunting tune, very eerie. A blind man who sells balloons ends up using his keen observances and hearing of the whistling and putting 2 and 2 together...eventually aiding in his capture and bringing the killer to justice.The imagery is haunting,the whistling is creepy and really grates on your nerves, the scariness is more of a what you dont see kind of deal  ... Ive also have heard this film somewhat models the story of German serial killer Peter Kurten aka the Vampire of Dusseldorf who in 1929 was commiting assaults and murders of children. Fritz denied the movie having anything to do with Kurten yet there is a similiarity between the film and the murders that occurred... though this could have been a coincidence.This is definitely an acquired taste.. Not for everyoneBut I have to say this...If you have a short attention span, dont buy this film.",Positive
"My feelings for this iconic piece of filmmaking mirror those I've previously expressed for David Lynch's masterpiece `Eraserhead'; namely that it exceeds the boundaries of perfection and thus defines the very word that is `film'.  There are very few films today that can even come close to capturing the brilliance that is captured within the frames that make up `M', a harrowing story about a murderer of children who manages to elude the police but finds himself in the angry hands of the criminal underground.  `M' (shortened from the original title `Eine Stadt Sucht Einen Morder' which translates to `The Murderers are Among Us') broke many boundaries and paved the way for the expressive filmmaking of today, but still it holds it's own as supremely better than most everything released today.`M' tells us the story of Hans Beckert and the misery and panic he spread throughout a small German city.  As children come up missing and or dead parents and concerned citizens alike find themselves in disarray as the police continue to search for this killer of children with no real success and or advancements.  As the police too begin to panic in their faulted efforts they begin to weigh heavy on the German community which has some adverse effects on the criminals controlling the underground.  These criminals come together to try and better their own situation which leads them to conclude that the only way they will get the police off of their backs is if they catch and put an end to this horror of a man once and for all.There are so many facets to this film that make it one of the grandest of all time.  It sets a perfect mood for the subject at hand, never once straying from that eerie and heart stopping vibe that permeates the screen.  The film flows magically from one scene to the next, never chopping and or losing our interest.  The rich black and white film and grainy atmosphere only add weight to the already weighty subtext; and then there is the sublime inclusion of the tune `In the Hall of the Mountain King', which is whistled by Beckert while he is on the prowl.  It is a simple detail, but that one detail is probably the most haunting facet to the entire film.And then, there is Peter Lorre.Peter Lorre has received much acclaim and attention for this gutsy role, tackling the first ever on screen serial killer, and rightfully so.  His fearless performance is one of the greatest of all time.  There is a scene where he is staring in the window of a toy store, watching a young girl in a mirror and his face bleeds forth with this wretched pain and confusion; utter torment eating away at his very soul.  He makes this man human, which was very gutsy especially at the time.  His final breakdown towards the end of the film where he tries to explain his horrible condition, his sickness if you will, is actually quite moving in his dire conviction and commitment to his performance.  It reminds me of the shivers one receives when witnessing Edward Norton's portrayal of Neo-Nazi Derek in `American History X'; a horrible man yet so convincing in his plight you wind up sympathizing with the Devil.`M' is not a film to be taken lightly.  There is so much power packed within this picture that one should be made aware of its affects on an individual.  `M' captures almost all too well the true extensive deteriorating powers of panic and fear.  As the general public begins to wear down with the police's inability to capture this murderer they begin to turn on one another, ready and willing to condemn any man who comes within speaking distance of a child.  The police likewise resort to rash and overzealous methods in order to uncover this murderer, feeling pressured by the innocent public merely trying to safeguard their offspring.  The criminals too feel compelled to take matters into their own hands in an effort to rid their town of its eternal distress and all of this culminates into a melding pot of dread and misery.`M' may be hard to stomach at times.  No, this is not a graphic film but it is haunting in that it manages to strike at the heart of the audience, seeping into their soul.  The aftereffects are as distressing as those brought on by the recent `4 Luni, 3 Saptamani si 2 Zile' (`4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days'); a film that brings out in us the human desire to correct all evils and save our loved ones from the exhausting touch of pain and suffering.  `M' is a film that finds itself in your heart and soul and wrecks havoc on your inner being; ultimately becoming a part of you and thus never leaving your side.  As many have noted, `M' is one of the greatest films ever filmed, and I too stand by that statement.In fact, it's quite possibly the best; possibly.",Positive
"The title M comes from a chalk mark (for 'murderer') placed by a beggar on the back of a suspected serial child killer.Fritz Lang's M (1931) remains remarkably modern despite premiering in the early sound era. Peter Lorre as the homicidal maniac shines in the last 20 minutes or so, after he's cornered by an organized gang of street people and taken to an abandoned warehouse for a mock trial by every grifter, burglar, robber and miscreant in Berlin.Nothing Lorre ever did subsequently approaches the passion and fear for his life that he exudes in this unfogettable scene in front of a crowd of low-lifes who convicted him even before he was ever apprehended.Lang's experimentation here with extreme camera angles, shadows, rapid cuts and earthy language surpass anything seen in the U.S. at that time and because of these, M has a timeless quality.The film originally ran 117 minutes and was cut drastically for a 1960 re-release to just over 90. In recent years, bits and pieces long ago excised have been found and restored, so that with DVD editions such asCRITERION COLLECTION's, M now clocks in at 109+ minutes.",Positive
"To classify M as a simple melodrama, or a thriller, or a crime drama would be to underestimate it. Fritz Lang's M is, at parts, tremendously funny. At others, it is immensely disturbing and psychological. But always M holds us in it's grasp; riveting, gripping, and brilliant.One of the first films about a serial killer, released before that term had even become popular, M didn't just give us one of the most compelling and twisted villains in cinematic history, it makes us identify and perhaps even sympathize with him. The impact of M cannot be understated, as it gave us one of the Golden Age of Hollywood's greatest character actors: Peter Lorre (Casablanca, The Maltese Falcon), popularized police procedurals and serial killers in cinema, and influenced countless other famous filmmakers with it's brilliant expressionist cinematography and visual style.Though the plot is blindingly simple (A child-hunting serial killer holds Berlin in terror and paranoia. When the police's methods get increasingly desperate and dangerous for underground criminal bosses to sit easy, they send out their own men to apprehend the murderer. Finally, the killer is marked and followed...), M is a complex film that still resonates within our day and age, with it's subtle commentary on our modern society. It's final message (""Someone must watch over the children"") is a little forceful, but Lang get's his message across with haunting effectiveness. I think this is a movie we need more than ever today.Of course, most praise should go to Peter Lorre, who before his role as baby-faced serial killer Hans Beckert was mainly known as a song-and-dance man. After? He was shot to international fame and became one of Hollywood's most sought after actors. The praise is hugely deserved. Lorre gets under your skin and stays there for a long, long time. As Beckert he is unbelievably creepy - Lorre's mirror scene will send chills up your spine, and the sight of his face illuminated by a flashlight like a deer in the headlights is unsettling on a psychological level. But it is in Lorre's electrifying final scene that he establishes himself as one of cinema's greatest actors. And this is his greatest performance. His final speech is one of the most compelling, disturbing, and gripping scenes I have scene in any cinema. Top marks for the true simmering intensity lying under that mask of pudgy innocence. This is one for the ages.I want to touch on just one more thing: the stunning visuals. You really shouldn't expect any less from Fritz Lang - this is the megalomaniacal genius that gave us cinema's first sci-fi - Metropolis. But the film is full of arresting imagery of almost startling clarity and beauty. Scenes and shots linger long in the mind after they are seen, and the cinematography (shadows, lights, and darks especially) is the kind that directors dream about in their sleep. But as I said before, this is FRITZ LANG we are talking about!In conclusion, I can only say: _watch_ M. A classic, but still relevant today, M is a showcase for a peerless and haunting performance from Peter Lorre as one of cinema's most twisted and chilling villains, brilliant visuals, and with a sharp plot, dark humor, satire, and subtle social commentary...this is one of the GREATEST films in foreign cinema. Ever. 10/10.",Positive
"This film is easily in the Top 5 of Fritz Lang's best films, and quite possibly his #1 best sound film as well.  In addition to being Lang's debut sound film, it was also Germany's very first sound film, and really goes to show the benefits of having waited a little while to move away from silents and into sound pictures.  Almost every sound film from the late Twenties and very early Thirties suffers from a static camera and almost nonstop chatter, as though film-making just went backwards in time by about 30 years and reverted back to being filmed stage plays instead of true ""motion pictures.""  But by 1931, a number of those wrinkles had been ironed out, and what resulted is an absolute masterpiece.  And unlike a number of directors working in those very early years of sound, Lang struck a very good balance between dialogue scenes and scenes of relative silence.  He knew that the actors didn't have to be talking nonstop for it to be a good film worth watching.  Of course, the director is only one part of the film's genius; the actors are brilliant too, in particular Peter Lorre, who truly gave the performance of his career even though it was his first starring role.  The film also really sets the stage for the later film noir genre, what with the terrific shadows, lighting, and suspenseful mood and atmosphere.The film does start out a little slowly, but before long it gets more and more intense and compelling.  The plot needs time to be established and for the viewer to be fully drawn into it.  Lang did suspense and crime thrillers so well, and this film is no exception.  A child murderer is on the loose, and with no answers in sight, the townspeople become paranoid and bloodthirsty, particularly when it comes to those whom they already know are criminals.  The people in the underworld suffer the most from all of these paranoid accusations, and so resent how their community is suffering that they resolve to not only find the murderer themselves, but to do it all without any help from the police, who in turn have no idea what these criminals are up to.  Even criminals have standards; it's often said that child rapists and murderers are reviled by ""ordinary"" criminals because that goes far beyond the pale of the things they did.  When the criminals finally track down Hans Beckert, the murderer, at a warehouse, they tie up the night watchmen so they won't alert the police, so insistent are they on capturing him by themselves, even as they race to find him and get everyone back out before the police might get there.  The final section of the film, in the criminals' kangaroo court, is one of the most powerful scenes ever set to film.One starts out feeling repugnance at this menace, this person who molests and kills children, but by the time the film is up, one can't help but feel sorry for him, or at least see him as a human being.  We never see him hurting children, and don't even see his face right away.  He's not shown as a monster or an evil person; indeed, who would ever suspect that such a baby-faced rotund man would be a child molester or murderer?  The treatment of him is surprisingly progressive for the era.  While what he's done isn't being excused or apologised for, he's ultimately shown to be a victim himself, a very sick man haunted by this monster inside of him, doing these horrible horrible things because of it, only finding peace when he's committing these criminal acts.  Is he any worse than these career criminals who have chosen to live this lifestyle, people who could have become bank tellers, teachers, or doctors, people who had a choice because they didn't have this monster constantly following them?  This must have been a positively revolutionary idea in 1931, when many people blamed people like Beckert instead of considering that there might be medical or scientific reasons for it, when criminals were given no sympathy and viewed as unreformable menaces to society instead of human beings who were made prisoners by something beyond their control.  It's the kind of film that stays with one long after viewing it, and only gets better with multiple viewings.Extras include audio commentary, an interview with Fritz Lang a year before his death (once again he tells the  tall tale of his meeting with Goebbels and how he left Germany late at night with barely any money, never to return until after WWII, even though his passport and other historical evidence paint a quite different picture!), the mini-documentary 'A Physical History of M,' a gallery of pictures, stills, and drawings, an interview with Harold Nebenzal (son of producer Seymour Nebenzal), a ten-minute version of 'M' made by Claude Chabrol, and excerpts from discussions editor Paul Falkenberg had with students in his film class as they watched the film.Overall, this is a must-see for anyone interested in film history; one can't claim to be a true student of classic film and never have seen it.  This film also seems to enjoy the distinction of being one of those films that just about everyone agrees is a classic and a terrific film, instead of one of those films that people are divided on about if it's great or if it's just overrated.",Positive
"Dark, disturbingly satirical, humorous exactly where you wouldn't expect it to be, and populated by strange-looking people, this would be the result if George Grosz had been a film director.",Positive
"&#34;M&#34; is a German expressionist film directed by the auteur Fritz Lang. It's the story of a child murderer, played brilliantly by Peter Lorre, and the people who are trying to track him down.Visually, the film is stunning. Lang uses shadows, and sound (or the lack thereof) to add to the tension created in the film.People who are serious fans of cinema DEFINITELY must see this.",Positive
"I've just now (minutes ago) finished seeing this film for the first time.I'm awestruck.Had this film been made by anyone other than Fritz Lang I'd have thought it impossible in the context of a film circa 1931.  Peter Lorre's performance as a child murderer is incredible.  His pleas for mercy when being ""tried"" by the underworld bosses is amazing.  The director spends an entire film making you hate his character and in a matter of seconds, Peter Lorre makes you understand the pathos, the compulsion, the madness that drives him to do what he does.  He relates real pain, real self hatred and true madness.  The cinematography is PERFECT.  Every aspect is flawless.  All this from a film made nearly three quarters of a century ago.It's in German.  Subtitles.  Big deal.  If you're even looking at this, you need to see it, period.",Positive
"While watching this story unfold, I found myself on quite a rollercoaster ride of emotion. First, I hated Beckert (Peter Lorre's character) for luring innocent little girls to their hideous deaths. Beckert is scary due to his ordinariness, his gentle face and small stature. He's the opposite of what we tend to expect (even today) a child molester / killer to look like. I really wanted this guy caught! I cheered for the cops to nail this maniac at all cost. Then, I wanted the underworld types to nab him and dole out their version of justice (regardless of their selfish, criminal motives). The scenes of the crooks surrounding / hunting Beckert in a deserted office building are paranoic and intensely claustrophobic. I could feel the terror in Beckert's head. No longer the predator, he was now the prey. Once caught, he is taken to a deserted brewery and put on &quot;trial&quot; by the crime bosses. Beckert must plead for his life before a mob that's not all that interested in his side of the story. He delivers one of the most desperate pleas for mercy in movie history to an audience concerned only with his destruction. Just as the mob leaps at him to tear him apart, the cops arrive, becoming Beckert's (temporary) salvation. In the end, we are left with the words of one of the victims' mother. She sadly states that while Beckert may die for his crimes, this will not bring her baby back to her. Such is the great paradox of justice. Fritz Lang gives us quite a lot to think about in this legendary tale. Buy it and see what I mean...",Positive
"Peter Lorre is the psychopathic child murderer who turns a whole German city upside down trying to track him down. The underworld gets in on the chase after the police, in doing their job so thoroughly, harass them so much they can't conduct business as usual (pretty funny when you think about it). Thus we have a race between the cops and the crooks to see who'll find Lorre first. The crooks win after getting a tip from a blind balloon seller (the blind leading the blind?).Any other director might have been satisfied with this ironic satire, but Fritz Lang goes after more: Lorre is what really interests him, the workings of a psychotic killer, the uncontrollable drives, the fear, the guilt. And Lorre, sweating profusely, eyes bulging, makes us feel what it must be like to be trapped in who he is. That is what makes this film so memorable. A great movie. Definitely worth a watch.",Positive
"Honestly, after reading some of the wonderfully written reviews here I cannot see myself even attempting to better this excellence.  Just going to say I watched it today and was astounded.  I originally started to watch it in English but as soon as Lorre came on, realized he didn't do his own voice-over. Stopped and begin the subtitled version. The imagery in this film will blow you away. Lorre is perfect in the part.  I've mostly seen him in comedic roles, the exception being CASSABLANCA, so this was a good opportunity to watch him strut his dramatic chops.On a lesser note, I enoyed seeing life in the 30's Germany. The washboard and the wash tub, the way the rooms looked as well as the way people dressed.Now, go read some of the other reviews. You won't be sorry.",Positive
"Peter Lorre is great  as the man who kills children.  M is an excellent film.  A man is killing children and the police are going after everybody with a record, so the criminals band together to find the killer to get the police off their backs. How these desperate characters work together makes a very compelling and suspenseful story.  Directed by Fritz Lang, who also directed the Sifi masterpiece metropolis, does a great job on his first talkie. Shortly after making this film Peter Lorre fled Germany and Fritz Lang followed shortly there after as both men were Jews.  I would highly recommend this movie.  It is in German with English subtitles, and after a while you don't mind reading them.",Positive
"I don't know if it is in writing somewhere, but if I was to guess I would imagine Alfred Hitchcock was a fan of Fritz Lang. The movie ""M"" is distinctly timeless and was I am sure quite modern thinking for it's time. Lang was known for his profound visual depictions of society. He had a keen eye and was probably the first to use lighting and different camera angles to establish a mood. Fans of his movies will tell you that he knew how to show us images of all walks of life that draw you into the story and relate to some aspect of your life that you can identify with on some level. What amazes me about his movies is with some slight modernizing changes like color, you have a current movie. The detail of the movie and thought provoking subject matter make it as relevant today as it was in 1931. Peter Lorre is outstanding as a serial killer out of control. He displays an uncanny ability to portray someone that even criminals hate. Anyone that enjoys murder mysteries should enjoy it, not just fans of old movies. If you enjoy it, be sure to seeThe Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray].CA Luster",Positive
"This is a very interesting film on so many levels, and very well presented by Criterion. The commentary is well-done and stays on topic, and the video is so crisp and clear you can't believe it was filmed in 1931. It's interesting to see just how far ahead German cinema was of its American counterpart at this point in time. Although there is not that much talking in this early German talking picture - Fritz Lang resisted going to sound in the first place - what conversation that does take place is well done and natural sounding. Compare it with any American film from 1931 and you can't help but see the difference.The murderer, artfully played by Peter Lorre, has been killing children that have no link to him personally for months. The police, despite all of their efforts, are unable to catch him, mainly because there is no rhyme or reason in his choice of victims. At first there is a focus on the victims and the hole left in their families by their killing. Then, the film shifts to two normally opposed groups - the police and the underworld. After several months of no results by the authorities, the police are unhappy because it reflects badly upon them, and the underworld is unhappy because their activities are being disrupted because of the police doing constant raids in their efforts to capture the killer.In a particularly well-done part of the film the scene shifts back and forth between a conference of police and one of the underworld. They discuss how they are going to catch the killer. The police settle upon the idea of looking for people with a history of past mental problems that were pronounced cured and released. The underworld decides to enlist an invisible group - the beggars - to follow every child at all times and therefore catch the killer. Both groups focus on the right suspect, the question is - who gets there first?M is a fascinating film that raises many topics - the death penalty, a group of criminals that are criminals by choice causing less stress on society than a lone criminal that acts out of an uncontrollable compulsion, and the motivations of the authorities often being their own bureaucratic survival rather than the larger issue of ending a series of horrible acts against humanity.",Positive
"This film came highly recommended by one of my college professors as a ""must watch"" film due to how good the film was as well as how Lang incorporated several things into his films that some films of the era did not. Having just finished the film a few hours ago, I can see why my professor liked it so much.M takes place in Berlin during the 1930s where a serial killer is at work. It is heavily implied that this isn't just an average killer- this twisted individual has been murdering children & has been implied to have done even more dastardly deeds to them at the same time. With the city both terrified & ambivalent to the murders- either accusing their neighbors with little cause or wondering why they should care- it is the city's criminal base that decides that they will step up & discover who the murderer is... and get rid of him themselves!While this won't be my favorite black & white thriller, this is something I can guarantee that I'll re-watch again. I loved how Lang managed to slowly build the tension of the movie as well as using great imagery (some of which is incredibly surreal to me) to heighten that tension. One of the most surreal scenes has to be the one where Lorre stalks his young victim, who is standing beneath a huge store window where an arrow continuously bobs up & down. It first seems to scream out to the audience the intent of the murderer, then pointing out the murderer himself as he later stands in front of the same window.As some of the other reviewers have stated, any people in the movie besides Lorre & his victims seem to be almost featureless & indistinguishable from each other & I can't help but wonder if that was purposely done by the director. This might irritate some viewers who want all of their main players fleshed out or more clearly defined. The quality of the movie was very good, so I'm guessing that Criterion worked out the kinks with their version of the film. There were parts of the film where my mind drifted a little, but overall the film was an incredibly good watch. The ""court"" scene with Lorre is one of the most well acted scenes I've seen in a long time. (Count me in as a new Lorre fan!)If you are a film student, you have to watch this film- it is incredibly good. If you aren't, then I recommend it anyway. It might not be something that everyone will want to rush out & own, but it is something that warrants at least one rental from your local video store.",Positive
"Hi I have a friend named M. and it was his name that mademe feel I should watch this JEWEL of a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!In this masterpiece of film Peter Lorre in what I feelis his best role plays a pathetic child murderer whodoes not want to kill children,but feels HE MUST!With Fritz Lang's splendid SHADOW directing andeerie lighting this is a morbid film and onethat I feel is the father of the PSYCHO,HENRY,SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,SCHRAMM and UNTOLD STORY... M will always bethe PAPA of those films. We start out with a younggirl missing,she is not the first nor the lastand every one in town that is male is a suspect.Later we follow a man who whistle's a classicaltune(it's famous but I don't know what it ismy sweetie will though,I'll ask her)The man stopsto buy a balloon for a lil girl,what the man doesnot know is he is being watched! As he leaves withwhat seems to be another victim for him a man bumpsinto him touches his back and say's sorry. WhatLorre does not know is that the man wrote M on his handbefore touching Lorre and when the girl tells him hehas something written on his back the look on his face(THE COVERBOX of this film)is brilliant! He runs leaving the girldoes he get caught? Does he kill himself??does he kill the menafter him??? You will have to buy and find out. This is a truemasterpiece on the macabre and opened so many doors for this kind.So thanks to my AMAZON friend M. For I would not have bought thistonight if you had the name N. Thinks for being a great friendand having a coooool name! Now watch this(but with the lights onand a stuffed Snoopy under your arm with a frozen otter pop toeat)",Positive
"This creepy, German expressionist film by Fritz Lang is everything the critics say it is. A serial killer of young girls is the subject of a huge manhunt by the police. The criminal elements have a tough time conducting their business with the cops everywhere. They decide to hunt the man, too, and kill him when they find him. Peter Lorre is the killer, driven by compulsions he doesn't understand. His plea for mercy during a ""trial"" by the criminals raises what might have been excellent melodrama to real drama. Lorre and his speech create sympathy for the man that is uncomfortable. ""I want to escape, to get away! And I'm pursued by ghosts. Ghosts of mothers and of those children... they never leave me. They are always there... always, always, always!, except when I do it, when I... Then I can't remember anything. And afterwards I see those posters and read what I've done, and read, and read... did I do that? But I can't remember anything about it! But who will believe me? Who knows what it's like to be me? How I'm forced to act... how I must, must... don't want to, must! Don't want to, but must! And then a voice screams!...""The movie is an endless pleasure of deep shadows, wet streets, musty cellars, clouds of cigar smoke and composed scenes that drive us along. You'll never look again at a staircase as just a way to get someplace.",Positive
"I wonder why Criterion skimped on their usual great extras for this release, but the print quality is remarkable and so is the movie.",Positive
"M the film, shows the life and times of a serial child killer and the way his psychotic obsession drives him to kill. Peter Lorre gave a master class in acting in this disturbing film. The Criterion restoration is simply superb, reminding us that b&w can heighten the tension and drama. Cannot recommend this enough.",Positive
"This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs.",Positive
"When does a movie become a classic ? Why german-american  director Fritz Lang's M does belong to this film category ? Because of the visual power of certain of the scenes shown in this movie. The lunar face of Peter Lorre will stay printed in our head for the rest of our life, like Leonardo Da Vinci LA JOCONDE. Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt suite will also never sound the same for you after M.Another theme treated by Fritz Lang in M is the psychology of the crowd. Always opposed to the behaviour of a single person, the crowd for Lang is dangerous, it is the place of evil. Peter &quot;M&quot; Lorre says that he's not guilty because he cannot defend himself against his pulsions. Strangely, the people in a crowd adopt the same defense, saying that something stronger than their individual will has pushed them to act in a different than usual way. In his second american movie FURY, Fritz Lang will masterfully treat again this theme with Spencer Tracy as leading character.No bonus features with this Criterion release except for english subtitles. The sound is excellent but images are not perfect : for instance, a white horizontal line appears after 60 minutes on the upper surface of the copy.A DVD which is already in your library.",Positive
"""M"" is one the rare films where viewing it is compulsory.  Director Fritz Lang has you in his grip from first frame to last.  This is essentially two films.  A child murderer is on the loose in Weimar Germany.  Panic and paranoia is rampant among the populace.  The police are using state-of-the-art(for the time) techniques to track the killer.  The underworld is in a lather.  Their efforts to nab the killer are not so much altruistic.  Rather he's bad for business.  The killer's identity is no secret.  As the public speculates as to who the murderer could be Lang reveals pudgy, fey Hans Beckert(Peter Lorre).  The second half of the film is a treatise on vigilanteism.  It is here that Lang demonstrates his belief in civil justice even in the face of the worst atrocity.  Beckert, pleaing for his life, manages to rend your heart while admitting to his monstrosity.  There are many powerful images on display here none the least the statement that closes the film by the mother of one of Beckert's victims.  This film would be a good pairing with another Lang film that concerns itself with mob rule, ""Fury"".",Positive
"German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.  This is a stark, facinating film.",Positive
"""M"" was a pioneering effort when Fritz Lang directed it, a lifetime ago, and it's still well worth watching. But 72 years later, it's lost a bit of its edge. Peter Lorre was primarily a stage actor at the time he appeared in ""M"" and by today's standards  his performance in the famous ""underground trial"" scene verges on scenery-chewing. And while the print used to produce Criterion Collection DVD is mostly clear, the subtitles [are bad] ... sentences are broken in odd places, and often several characters' lines appear all together, before an exchange is half over.  If you've never seen this movie, and you have any serious interest in the development of the art form, you definitely ought to see it. But don't expect edge-of-your-seat tension throughout!",Positive
"This film left me numb. The final scenes hit me with a power I had never before experienced. Peter Lorre plays a child murderer (immaculately, I must add) being pursued, throughout the course of the film, by not only the police, but the underground crime syndicate as well. Lang's use of the newfound sound technology is absolutely brilliant, as is his visual style. The opening scene shows shots of empty alleys, stairwells, and a lost balloon stuck in power lines over the sound of a mother calling for her child, instead of showing the actual killing itself. And its worth seeing for that alone.",Positive
"This is a wonderful new release from the Criterion Collection! The quality is far superior to their earlier release of the same film.Forgetting the extra DVD, the image-quality alone makes this new release all the worthwhile for serious collectors. The screen is entirely fit this time - you'll actually see black bars on the RIGHT and LEFT of your screen, as the film is presented in a unique aspect-ratio that it was originally shot in.The grain is scarce. The blacks are deep and rich. The dust & scratches are minimal, and this picture yields a much crisper and sharper image than anything we've ever had before. It's a pretty damn good restoration job if I say so!If this were most other movies in film history, I might agree that another DVD release is a blatant exploitation, but ""M"" is not most movies. If there is a better version out there of some of these 'ultra-legendary' films such as Fritz Lang's ""M"", then please someone, make them available to us. I understand that there's been a fairly recent restoration attempt done on Murnau's ultra-legendary ""Nosferatu""...where's the DVD release?At least with this new and largely impressive upgrade of ""M"", we got it!Thank You! Worth it for fans.",Positive
"This is the first Criterion release that I've ever seen and I have to say that I am quite impressed.  Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" has been very well restored and although the picture quality is not perfect which would be unreasonable to expect of a 80-year film and the sound quality is also not perfect but in this case is not essential as the film works very well with Lang's direction and hence unique storytelling style making this is likeThe Complete Metropolis [Blu-ray] a few years earlier a film classic and another work of genius.  The rolling ball and the flying kite scenes for example ""speaks"" volumes and does more than tons of dialogue could do and if ever a film shows that a picture speaks a thousand words this one is it.Fritz Lang addresses another social ill here as he did in ""Metropolis"" but unlike that film the actual lesson is elusive.  The special features here are excellent and include an excellent interview conducted by director William Friedkin ofThe Exorcist (Extended Director's Cut & Original Theatrical Edition) [Blu-ray] andThe French Connection (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)of Lang in which he explains his intention was to instruct adults to be much more mindful of their children and that there is no excuse for neglecting them as they are the future and how well we look after them will determine what kind of a future we will have.  This was so prophetic when you look at Germany not too long after with the Hitler youth that was so important for the Nazi party for example or how misguided youth can lead to tragic consequences when due to negligence parents allow unsavoury elements to replace them.  The parents blame the police, the various criminal elements, the actual psychopathic killer, how busy they are with work i.e. everyone but themselves for the deaths.  Lang even in a way tries to weaken the case for blaming the perpetrator who is portrayed as this killer who wants to be caught witness his letter to the police inexplicably leaving clues to aid in his capture and in his impassioned apologetic for himself in front of the mob which even evokes sympathy for him.  This was very enlightening as because of various producer interference and hence various alternate endings and cuts which can be seen in the English version also included in this set it became very hard to see this thesis resulting in many people talking about how this film was about compassion for the insane criminal, the abolition of capital punishment for the insane, how insane is insane enough, the hypocrisy in society of how the ""low-life"" are targeted and assumed of the horrible crime of child murder when the perpetrator stands among the more ""respectable"" at least in society's eyes, the comedy of ""low-lifes"" judging a ""lower life"" etc.These are just a few lessons one can draw from the movie without viewing the movie in full and hence in the way the director intended it to be and you get it here as complete and as well restored as can be to date but only in the original German version which is the best way to view this; turn on the English subtitles if you need to as the English version hasn't been restored and the ending has been changed and so doesn't flow as well and is a pale parody of the German version.  What the German mother says as the last line of the film is critical to the meaning and is totally lost in the English version which has an alternate ending.  The fact that a 110 minute film generates so many talking points and is still relevant today with violence in various forms against children still rampant with many people blaming various things and pointing to various reasons when perhaps the answer is just better vigilance and spending more time with them so that the evils of the world can't get at them is testament to the greatness of this film and of Fritz Lang.  Indeed this to me is the definition of a great film that transcends time and remains relevant and thought-provoking even rewarding many repeated viewings and it is really sad that we don't get enough of these types of films today and we have to settle for mindless crap like ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", ""Dumb & Dumber"", ""Legally Blonde"", ""Scream"" etc.Great Criterion release, well restored but not perfect picture and sound quality, great extras and excellent film makes this an easy review.Very highly recommended!",Positive
"In 1931 Berlin, 8 children have fallen victim to a murderer.  Suspicion abounds on the city streets, and the police have very few leads to follow.  To expand their search for the killer, the police raid the dens of the underworld, infuriating the crime bosses.  How could the police think that a murderer of children would be included in their ranks!!  They may be theives and prostitutes, but even they wouldn't stoop so low as to harm a child.  In an effort to rid themselves of such a terrible mark, the criminals take it upon themselves to track down and to bring their own form of justice this terrible person.&quot;M&quot; is Fritz Lang's first &quot;talkie&quot; and is filled with great camera shots and very little sound.  Sound is only used when necessary, giving this a great mix of the silent era and the new age of the talking pictures.  The story is wonderfully told and displays one of the finest performances of Peter Lorre's acting career.  His portrayal of the child killer is chilling and beautifully acted.  An incredible film.",Positive
"Okay, so I'm loosely using the phrase ""masterpiece of German cinema"", as I have not covered a massive demographhic of German cinema, but for what I have seen, M is definitly a sheer masterpiece. I started by buying a cheap DVD at my mall once containing Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" (which is now my favorite film of all time), in any case, the film blew me away, so, I looked it up online, then saw the director's filmography. This was on IMDb.com, and I saw his film ""M"" was on the Top 250. Ranked pretty high, and with an intricate plot, I chose to look for it. With no luck at the mall, I tried Best Buy, my first choice for DVDs, and wouldn't you know it, ""M"" is in. So I pick it up, watch it as soon as I get home.Wow. This film is impeccible. As I write this, I'm going through a phase of  watching alot of foriegn cinema, mostly German and French movies. This is by far and away the best.Criterion's transfer and restoration is great. Clear, crisp picture quality, a job well down. While it has a different, European ""letterbox"" transfer, the look is subtle, as I myself don't pay much mind to it. Also, it's stocked full of features, short film, interviews, enough to cover for Criterion's price tag.And as a film, it's just amazing. The acting by Peter Lorre was great, and different considering I had just watched him in ""Casablanca"" in my film class. The plot is very unique. A harrowing tale of a child murderer in Berlin, with the growing unrest in the city. A chase ensues for him, and the end culminates in an interesting show-down of sorts.This movie gets my highest recommendation, 5 out of 5. A brilliant film, highlighting on of my favorite decades in film, the 30s, and is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good thriller.",Positive
"This is probably one of the best films depicting a serial killer that I have ever come across. The movie plot is pretty absurd with the whole of the self-rightous &quot;underground&quot; world of criminals uniting to catch the kindermorder who thretens to blacken their reputation! The Nazi propaganda is typically moronic, but that can safely be ignored to get to the climax where Lorre is being &quot;tried&quot; by the gangsters and gangland killers who think they are so much superior to them and he launched into his tirade. The killer is not an evil man, but one driven by an insane urge to kill, regardless of the consequences. Unlike the rest of the criminals who prosecute him, he does not do what he does for gain, but because his very nature, a drive that is alien even to him, forces him to obey. The sheer power of Lorre's perfromance, especially in the prosecution scene, blasts most other movies out of the water. There are few scenes as intense and revealing as this one. As a member of the progeny of UFA's expressionist classics, the movie is visually quite stunning and of course, highly artifical in its plot and acting, but this in no way takes away from its dramatic power. I wonder how it would have turned out had Lang not been under the Nazi censors wh forced hom to fell for his life a few years later?",Positive
"This famous Fritz Lang classic is about a child murderer in Germany who finally meets justice not at the hands of the authorities but by fellow undesireables.The story is said by many  to be loosely based on the true story of the vampire of Dusseldorf .However the murderer in this movie  is not only a monster, he is a complex character that is also somewhat charming and childlike himself. So when we are not being repulsed by him we might find ourselves identifying him. Indeed when he stands in judgement before a judge and jury of criminals he might indeed be a symbol of all humanity.The movie is  a watershed  in film making in many ways and was perhaps the first successful ""talkie"" of the continent.The  short title is the one that made it through the Nazis censors who would not allow the  word 'murder"" or ""murderer""(or in this case the working title of the movie which was ""Murderer are Among Us"") in the title of a movie.It stars Peter Lorre who was more famous at the time as a surrealist than as a member of the movie trio that included  Humprey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet. The murders occur in squlid neighborhoods and this adds to making the movie quite atmospheric. The police in trying to track the murderer down use what were at that time modern investigative techiques making this moive the the grandfather to all crime movies and TV crime dramas.But this is more than just an atmospheric murder mystery as it was a veiled but direct attack on the culture of the Nazi regime as well as a philosophicl discourse and an exploration of the human psyche.Highly recommended.",Positive
"THE GERMAN BLU-RAY HAS THE MOST COMPLETE VERSION TO DATE, HOWEVER, CRITERION EDITION AND GERMAN EDITION HAVE DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND SPECIAL FEATURES. BUY BOTH, FELLAS!",Positive
"This picture adds another superb guerdon to the well known artistic trajectory of this visionary filmmaker, who expressed the fears and the complex and profound state of desperation, anguish and hopeless in the Weimar Republic.The extraordinarily well elaborated script begins with a precognitive burden: ""Just you wait a little while/ The evil man in black will come/ With this little chopper/He will chop  you up"". And this brutal murder of Elsie Beckman an innocent child is the undermost expression of insanity a sick mind can commit. But these terrified eyes represent a huge crowd of hungry souls that needed desperately to be fed by illusions.The demolishing and dreadful human chase will include not only the one hundred per cent of the police forces but besides - and here Fritz Lang goes again with his admirable genius touch - the underworld participates too due the interference of the police in the affairs of the ""legitimate crooks"", using the ""Beggars Union"" which will be hired to watch any liitle suspicious movement.Butt  the sublime irony has not finished yet. Once the murder is apprehended, he will be judged by a court of the underworld where members of the jury will include mothers of the murdered children. Make an instantaneous link with The Devil and Daniel Webster `s judgment and you will realize the surprising analogy.In casting the role of Franz Becker, the murderer, Lang sought to use the accustomed stereotype criminal, when he saw to Peter Lorre, a young Hungarian, Lang didn't think it twice and offered him the role, ignoring perhaps Lorre would play the role of his career.But  this character was even enhanced by the towering acting of Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohman and Gustaf Grundgens as Schr&auml;nker in the role of underworld boss.The rest runs for you. And please remember the final statement if there would be still any doubt : ""We, too, should keep closer watch on our children.""  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave.This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance. As the same Fritz stated in 1971 during an interview: ""We force the one who throws the switch or pours the poison into the room...to commit the same crime for we kill another...""",Positive
"""M"" is one of the greatest German films ever made. Hitchcock had deep admiration for it and it is easy to see how this film influenced him as much as it did. The film operates on several different levels: a suspense film about a serial killer of children; a psychological study of a deviant; a stunning directorial work of style; a probing look at free will vs. compulsion. There are many scenes here that are brilliantly framed and filmed. Lang arranges the scenery and the actors for full compositional effect. Peter Lorre gives a great performance as the deviant. The ending frame is of a hand descending from above on Peter Lorre as if saying that perfect justice is only possible with God. This is a film full of intelligence and skill. It shouldn't be missed.",Positive
"and this is one of the most suspenseful movies you will ever view. Directed by the great German director Fritz Lang in 1931 this is one film that will keep you on edge as the events unfold in the story. Starring Peter Lorre as the serial killer Hans Beckert this may well be Lorre's best acting performance and that says a lot considering what a great acting career he had. As for the director, Fritz Lang had a stellar career himself behind the camera. Best known for the silent classic ""Metropolis"", ""M"" (which would be Lang's first sound movie) might well be Lang's masterpiece. It is a story that looks both at the uncontrollable madness Beckert falls into to kill while at the same time looking at how the murders of young girls effect society as it deals with the horrors of the murders. That makes ""M"" just as much a psychological thriller as a suspense movie. There are certainly twists and turns to the film to. As the police become more frustrated in not being able to find any kind of evidence to show who the killer is while the public hounds them for results in capturing the murderer the criminal element in the city begin hunting for the killer as well. The police are leaving no stone unturned in their hunt for the unknown killer which includes busting up all the illegal activities the local gangsters are running in their quest to find this person. That of course is interfering with the gangsters profits so they decide to hunt for the killer too to bring him to their version of justice. The movie then becomes a race to see who can capture the killer first once both sides finally figure out who the unknown serial murderer is.To make this such a great experience to watch is the work that has gone into restoring the film to its original state. The transfer of the film onto DVD is outstanding. I have a copy of ""M"" on VHS tape that is about 20 to 25 years old. The picture on that is grainy and faded in places and there are parts to the movie that are missing. But with the work done to restore the movie thanks to todays technology the picture is clear, crisp and many of the missing parts of the film have been added again bringing better continuity to the story line.This is one suspense film I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who is a fan of this genre of movie. The film does come with subtitles so you can understand what is being said plus there is a second disc with all kind of special features including a 1975 interview with Fritz Lang conducted by William Friedkin. For the serious movie collector this is one film you just got to add to your collection.",Positive
"Fritz Lang's great 1931 film M is an important film, and for anyone who collects classic films, a necessary addition. Criterion's 2 CD set is simply wonderful, with the complete 110 minute Lang approved version of M on disc 1, and a William Friedkin interview with Fritz Lang made a year before his death, among other goodies on disc 2.M was Fritz Lang's 1st movie made with sound, although a few sequences were actually silent. This film is one of the last great examples of German Expressionism, as well as a precursor in terms of visual style and plot to the classic film noir of a decade later. This film is about a serial child murderer, played by Peter Lorre, and the efforts of both the police, and organized crime, to catch him. This was Lorre's first screen role, and it not only typecast him as a villian for years to come, but was used by Goebbels in the vile propaganda film ""The Eternal Jew"" as an example of Jewish immorality and corruption.The visual elements in the film are particularly striking and memorable. The children playing a morbid game of ""next victim""; a little girl bouncing a ball off the murderer's wanted poster while his shadow suddenly appears; the dirty deed done, signified by her ball rolling away and her balloon flying off; a potential new innocent victim framed in a mirror by knives; the mark of ""M"" applied to the murderer which can't be erased. There is also that ominous leitmotif of the murderer constantly whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"".Lorre is riveting in this movie. It really is the only great acting done here, but it makes up for everything else. He becomes a human rat, scurrying to escape, trapped in a cage, frantic, and in the end, pitiful and almost pitiable. The fact that his final tormentors are sane career criminals, while Lorre's character has sanity issues, gives the film a final moral ambiguity that almost overshadows the repugnance we feel toward him.",Positive
"Amazing how the old school films had no need for all the gore and over-explicit graphics often used in modern filmography. This film offers a look at a very true and realistic problem that seems to have been haunting societies since old. It makes one see that fine line between true sickness of the mind and and a plain criminal one. This must have been a very controversial film for its time but it brings something that has to be dealt with. Again, is amazing how no over explicit graphics are needed in order to awake one's imagination. Not that I don't like graphics, is just that sometimes the imagination does a better job at imaging and bringing true tension to the scenes. Very well made film and classic for all times. Superb role for Peter Lorre. A better actor for this charachter could have never been found.",Positive
"Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with ""Metropolis"", an early pinnacle for director Lang.",Positive
"If he did it could have been Fritz Lang & his seminal talkie, M, made in 1931 & released in 1933. A deranged child murderer is loose in the city (played broadly & wonderfully by ""newcomer,"" Peter Lorre).The movie has scenes pitting citizen v. citizen, in accusations & counter accusations, near lynchings & mob hysteria. The police seem helpless & bereft of clues. Organized crimes seeks to find the murderer also. He's bad for business.Crowd mentality is examined. It is a theme Lang returns to in later movies. His first American movie, Fury , (1936) deals with vigilantism & mob rule. This version, a poor print by the way, has English subtitles so you're forced to pay attention. It was Lang's favorite film. It is a prototype, if you will, of the murder mystery genre. Kind of a precursor to Hitchcock's thrillers of the 40's & 50's.",Positive
"Criterion has done it right again by presenting ""M"" the classic Fritz Lang masterpiece film in an outstanding 2 disc collection. This edition is worth owning in your film library. I enjoyed the bonuses especially the Fritz Lang interview along with the informative film commentary. This was Lang's first sound film. Let's not forget Peter Lorre's groundbreaking role as Beckert, the child killer. This edition is a must have!!!",Positive
"'M' was a film that was as beyond its time as it was enigmatic in title. Who could have imagined that 1931 audiences would have been able to stomach witnessing the harrowing descent in the fortunes of a Berlin  paedophile-homicide? The answer to that could well lie in Peter Lorre  alone. The instant he is shown, he clicks in our minds as the template for  any pervert-sociopath conjurable by any society. He is as pathetic as he is  depraved, the near-two hour run of the film lending tremendous scope to the  spiralling crash course he is on. Stripping away the heavy warning  overtones inherent to 'M', the viewer is really left to gape at a horrific  piece while feeling sprawled, reeling from an almost self-negating mix of  want for Lorre's destruction and the dread of capture to be found in any  set of chase sequences. The suspense surmounts as the minutes wear by,  begetting terror that is just too great to abstract from and contemplate.  The viewer is also left in a confused state because there is no protagonist  body at all to identify with, only a bruised satisfaction of evil quashed  by an unknowing coalition of societal elements being there to fill the  emotional void. There are but four players in this work: the Molestor, the  Mob, the Law and the Victims, each one turning like a set of gear-wheels in  a machine, but all at the same desperate, frenetic rate. The pervert's  capture and Mob trial are particularly intense areas of the story (this is  a part Lorre was created by God to play), the overpowering sense of dread  conveyed by the deluge of realism Lang's camera injects. Still, the Mob  itself is a phenomenon. These are REAL gangsters whom Lang utilised to  maximise effect and some of whom were arrested in real life during filming.  The mob trial they facilitate is too real to watch, too demanding on the  senses to appreciate as being merely an essential portion of the film.  Peter Lorre is a wounded, thrashing wolf one moment and a gibbering tangle  of Freudian/Durkheimian/Jungian cables the next.'M' is a documentary-film,  not the other way round.  As for the product itself: the print is as  good as any from the early Thirties. Several versions of the 1931 'M' are  in circulation and I don't think that this is the longest (try Eureka  videos in the UK). Given the merits of the work it contains, the price is  fair. This is really a more unsung hero in the Lang celluloid vault. It's  interesting to note that the 1951 French remake, while capable of holding  water as a film in its own right, just can't hold a candle to the  shock-value of this. This was Fritz Lang as Christopher Columbus,  discovering a territory in film that was not only unknown before but also  forbidden.",Positive
"""M"" is a film that is 75 years old, having came out in 1931. It's also in German and when movies that came out three years ago have been forgotten, this movie still thrives and frequently finds itself on a Great Movies list by some critic. In fact, the way I heard of it was through Roger Ebert's The Great Movies. ""M"" is a great movie. It's not, in my opinion, an entertaining film though. It's a great movie, because it's one of the first (if not the first) serial killer movie; It's got some good cinematography...From what I've heard about previous releases of this film (both DVD and VHS), I think I got lucky with the copy I obtained. The subtitles are clear, the sound quality is good, and the picture is all-right. The picture is far from perfect, but it's watchable. In this film, Peter Lorre (you may remember him from Casablanca, among other things) plays the semi-main character Hans Beckert. I say semi-main character because he's the character that the entire film is built on, but he has a miraculously small amount of screen time when you get right down to it. Hans Beckert is a serial killer and it's hinted about that he's a pedophile. It also says he is on the back cover, so I assume that he is. If someone could go get Lorre from 1931 and bring him into the future, every Hollywood director making a film about a serial killer would cast him. He's such a bug-eyed, creepy looking dude he fits the part so well. In the beginning of the film, we hover above some kids as they play a game. This game is a typical children's game, but the words they chant are a little more sinister than you'd expect. A few minutes later, one of the girls is kidnapped and killed. For the record, no murder is ever seen onscreen. You don't even get as far as seeing Beckert leading his victim off the screen and suddenly hearing screaming. Because of Beckert, the city is in turmoil. The police are desperately hunting the man down and so is the German underworld. Police raids are frequent and police are walking around so much, it's keeping other criminals from doing what they do best. The title ""M"" comes from a scene in the film where a man is following Beckert and is able to mark his jacket with the letter ""M"" (short for murderer) to follow him more easily. This is not a movie you'd rent for enjoyment; It's a movie you should check out, so you can say you've seen it. It's not a movie that will rub everybody the right way and it's certainly not the best film ever made, but it's ahead-of-it's-time cinematography and speeches (especially Lorre's at the end) make it worth it.GRADE: B-",Positive
"Sooo many reviews here fully explain details of this magnificent film. I bought/viewed it just knowing it was Fritz Lang directed, positively critiqued, and superbly re-presented by Criterion. That was enough for me. I didn't need to watch it while advance-knowing, ""this must be the part where..."". I thoroughly enjoyed the acting, story, and unfolding of events upon my first watch. Must folk know EVERYthing about a film before it is watched the first time? ""These are the plot twists...this is how it ends"": you might as well just save your money! (I especially loathe dvd marketing when spoilers are on the cover, or the menu screen!) Non-spoiling info: 1931, B+W, early sound -in German- with subtitles, and 'full-screen' (made before 'wide' era. AND, it's even narrower in scope at 1.19:1: they had to have space for the 'new' audio track. Trust me, you can deal with it). Note the rating graph/preponderance of 'five star' ratings, should you still be on the fence! (...and my mistake: I have the '04 Criterion dvd, not the blu. Superb quality nonetheless, and includes wealth of supplements)",Positive
"M is an essential film. But this DVD was a little disappointing, I felt. The picture and sound were better than other versions I've seen, but still not as pristine as I would have liked. Special features were so-so. Price was as high as Criterion usually likes it. All in all, I've seen better adaptations of similarly legendary films to DVD.But if you are at all interested in the great films of the past, this is a must-have, and Criterion MUST be kept in business at all costs (wince). So this is a good buy overall.",Positive
"I am a fan of Fritz Lang, but not a fan of murder films.  However, the Lang faniship overwhelmed my aversion to these crime films.  I think what keeps me back is the gore.  I think that depicted gore deadens your higher sensibilities.  By the way, I work in a hospital, so it is not squeamishness son my part.The key to this movie is Fritz Lang's incomparable eye.  He has the palace and artistic symmetry that would have made him a great Renaissance and Baroque artist.  Each scene is a masterpiece and a work of art.  This cinematography is a dying art in the film industry, focusing on computer generated gimmicks and machine gun profanity to carry the film along.  His style reminds us of Orson Welles, Gregg Toland, and Alfred Hitchcock.  Film is primarily visual, and Lang exploits this primary dimension of filmwork to its utmost.The black and white aspect to this film is powerful.  Admittedly, black and white originally was to due to the poor technology, but it has advantages that color lacks.  You feel shadows, and taste the darkness.  For example, in Lorre's first scene, you just see his silhouette in shadow whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King.""  This creates an almost hysterical sense of suspense. You know someone is bad, but you don't see him.  He becomes a phantom menace of colossal proportions.  This film is almost a moving study of Ansel Adams gone psycho!This film, however, is not mere eye-candy, but it raises many ethical situations.  The plot is that a kiddy murderer is on the loose in Germany, so the cops crack down on all criminals.  Realizing that their craft is in danger, the criminal underground unties in a sort of ""thief's honor,"" and tries to take care of the murderer on their own.  The film climaxes as the underworld capture the murderer and hold a trial on their own.  The entire situation raises so many questions about ethics, morals, honor, and vigilantism.The only drawback is that this talkie is in German, so your eye is constantly darting down to the dialogue.I am glad that this DVD is out and this profound film will get more exposure.  Yes, there was life before ""Titanic,"" and we have much to learn from these classic filmmakers.",Positive
"Perhaps the very first serial killer film ever made--way back in l931!Although, as far as directors go, I preffer the works of Claude Chabrol (especially Chabrol's The Butcher, over Lang's M), Lang's M holds up pretty damn well.What you really get here is three films in one: first third feels like a serial killer film, middle third feels like a police procedural, and the last third feels like a crime caper flick.For me, the first and last third worked exceptionally well. Peter Lorre convincing in the title role. Middle part (with the cops doing what cops do) lagged and felt drawn out, only because we have seen so many scenes like this over the years in other films of this nature.Friedkin interviews Lang in the two-disk package.",Positive
"I had heard &quot;M&quot; spoken of for many years as a masterpiece of German Expressionism, as an early psychological thriller, as the first portrait of a serial killer. For these &amp; other reasons, I had been interested in seeing it for a long time. Now that I have, I feel it is an  important movie, but for reasons totally ignored by most film buffs: it is an amazing document of early Hitler Germany, made in the very first years of his taking power. As a time capsule of German values &amp; beliefs it couldn't be more revealing!As &quot;M&quot; opens, we see some extremely dispirited looking children playing a singing game. In every scene of the movie that features a child, the children seem sedated, little zombies. Was this typical of German children of the period? Were they so benumbed by the economic disasters their parents endured that they had ceased to show any personality whatsoever? Or is this an example of the grinding propaganda they encountered in all aspects of their daily routine?The &quot;Who is the Murderer?&quot; posters Fritz Lang depicts posted in the town feature the following text: &quot;It is every mother's highest duty to guard her child at all times.&quot; Whew!! Somehow I can't imagine an Wanted poster in the US of 1931 preaching quite so blatantly! The police are shown to be fat &amp; lazy, the criminal underworld organized into unions, &amp; at all turns, the ugly apparatus of a police-state are exhibited. For instance, in one scene, the police decide to raid a &quot;known underworld hang-out&quot;. The people drinking there are herded together, run thru the gauntlet individually &amp; anyone who doesn't have full paperwork on them is arrested.Also on display in 3 scenes are examples of mob behavior, anonymous people gaining strength in numbers to gang up on an individual (whether guilty or innocent).The most disturbing subtext runs thruout the entire film. A whole city is in an uproar over the murders of 8 children. Yet within a decade these same people would be accomplices in the murders of millions of children.Yes, Fritz Lang's &quot;M&quot; is a classic, but not for any of the reasons usually given. If you have any knowledge of 20th Century German history, you will find it a fascinating time capsule &amp; a filmic explanation for the rise of the Nazi's. It is chilling &amp; very disturbing to watch.",Positive
"""Just you wait a little while,The nasty man in black will come,With his little chopper,He will chop you up!""It is interesting to see that the original iconic image for Fritz Lang's ""M"" was the letter written on the palm of a hand, which is what you see on the cover of the VHS edition.  Today the most famous short is what appears on the cover of the Criterion DVD edition, with Hanz Beckert (Peter Lorre) seeing his reflecting and finding the ""M"" imprinted on the back of his coat.  Certainly the latter image is the most memorable, but the former really does represent the film better.  Until the final scenes of the film at his ""trial"" where he gives his memorable speech, Beckert (Franz Becker in some translations) is more shadow than substance.  What stands out is the idea that the criminal underground would band together in an all-out effort to apprehend the child murderer, and would succeed where the legal authorities would not.  Even in Nazi Germany on the eve of the Hoolcaust, murdering children is beyond the pale for criminals.The opening scene of the film is the best part from a cinematic standpoint, as a increasingly worried Madame Beckmann (Ellen Widmann), waits for her daughter Elsie (Inge Landgut) to come home from school.  In the montage we see Elsie walking along the street bouncing a ball and then tossing it up against a light post.  The camera pans up to the bulletin asking, ""Who is the murderer?"" and then a shadow falls over it.  Whatever doubts we have are gone, for we know that poor little Elsie is doomed.  The strange little man in the black suit admires the ball and buys the little girl a balloon while her mother becomes more anxious at home.  Finally there are the shots an empty place setting at a table, of a ball rolling along the ground, and a balloon caught in electric wires before flying away.With the public's angry reaction to the death of yet another young girl, the police increase their efforts, raiding a bar to see what they can find.  While the police are trying to figure out what to do next so are the leaders of the underworld.  The break comes when the blind man who sells the balloons recognizes the tune the killer whistled the day he bought a balloon for Elsie.  Beckert has the habit of whistling ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" from Edvard Grieg's ""Peter Gynt"" suite (the whistling was dubbed by Lang himself).  Beckert is followed as he stalks his next victim and the tell-tale ""M"" is placed upon the back of his coat.  Trapped in an office building, Beckert is captured by the criminals and then placed on trial for his crimes.Tried before a court of underworld criminals, a terrified and bug-eyed Beckert tries to proclaim his innocence at first, but then suddenly confesses in an emotional outburst, screaming, ""I can't help myself!""  In time Lorre's performances would be reduced to caricature, easily imitated by even the most inept of impressionists, but here it is raw and powerful.  When he is confronted with the photographs of the young girls that he has killed, he flinches as if receive physical blows, which only serves to underscore the psychological nature of this classic film.  Up until this point the film has been more about technique and it is not until the child murderer is finally in their hands that the criminals try to come to terms with what sort of monster they have captured.Ultimately I think that in ""M"" the efforts of the criminals are best compared not with those of the police, but with the mob mentality that attacks one suspect on the street.  Such a scene presages Lang's first American film, ""Fury,"" but it also recalls the scene in Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" where the mob inflamed by Antony's funeral oration kills the poet Cinna for having the same name as one of the conspirators (and his bad verses).  Given what was happening in Germany in 1931, it is interesting to note that the violence of the streets, represented by Hitler's Brown Shirts, is personified not by the authorities but by the average men in the street.  I do not want to read too much into what Lang is trying to say about the Nazis in this film, but those who want to make a case for that perspective will find plenty to work with in ""M.""What we now have available is a fully restored version of this classic 1931 film, courtesy of the Munich Film Archive, which features a restored soundtrack, including Lang's originally intended long periods of silence (remember, this is Lang's first sound picture), and the frame size restored to its proper ratio.  What this means is that if you have not seen ""M"" in a long while the time has come for you to see it again.  ""M"" still succeeds today, even in black & white with subtitles, because Lang invokes both horror and pity for the murderer and his victims, and creates a compelling ""modern"" city in which these characters live.  Besides Lang and Lorre, the third person who deserves lots of credit is cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner, who also did F.W. Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" (although the stories and styles are decidedly different).  The rest is still a notch below the highest rank of films for that time, but it is still qualifies as ""must see.""",Positive
"This is a chilling film about a child murderer who terrifies a Berlin neighborhood.  The police seem to focus on the lowly criminals and prostitutes in the area and seem more interested in making a show of the hunt at least in the beginning.  The community members are terrified and numb at first then become activist in hunting for the killer.  Police eventually bring in skilled investigators who come close to catching the killer.  The people use a blind possible witness for better effect.  What happens to the killer, who captures him and his explanation form the essential thought provoking finale.  Capital punishment, evil deeds and uncontrollable compulsions are discussed and become part of the story.  The psychological background of the killer, the police and the community were ground breaking at the time.  The DVD comes with a story booklet, several interesting documentaries and quite a lot of information on Fritz Lang and German film-making at the time.  I found all very interesting.  Loved them.",Positive
"This is one seriously disturbing movie. Fritz Lang created several masterpieces (e.g., Metropolis) in his career, but M is unique. This was Lang's first ""talkie"" and to be honest the dialog means little to your ears if you're watching M and can't understand German (you can read English subtitles - very well done in the recent criterion release on DVD). Yet the ""talkie"" nature of M is critical when Lorre's character whistle's chords from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt before each chilling moment. I found this use of a simple repeated musically element to be one of the most effective I have ever heard in a film. If you don't like subtitles M won't be your cup of tea, but if they don't bother you then check this movie out. You'll have chills for a while I promise! 5 stars!*This review is of the Criterion 1999 version.",Positive
"This is more a review for the justice Criterion has done for Frtitz Lang's 1931 criminal masterpiece than it is a review of the film.  Chances are if you're reading this review, your already have an interest in this film and have heard of how incredible it is, so therefore an in depth study of it from some amateur film buff like me will do you little or no good.  Just see it and you'll know all you need to know about what makes it an unmistakebale clasic.My hat goes off (if I wore one) to the Criterion Collection, who have released an amazing print of this movie.  Not only are the German subtitles more involving and in depth, making the story easier to follow and all the expressions easier to understand, but the actual footage you see is so clear it is hard to believe this film is over 70 years old!  Even Kurosawa's IKIRU from the 1950s doesn't have such a high quality print available!  I've watched this film for several years (almost 10 now--since I was a teenager) and every time I see a new version of it, from video to DVD, it gets better and better.  The version Criterion presents is easily the longest of them all, and following the feature a breif description of the restoration and the time is presented just so you realise you've seen as close to the original film as you possibly can.  The other versions of this movie that I've seen were all shabby, at best.  I remember in 98 or 99, a video was released of the film that at the time was one of the most complete available, including the short finale just after the criminal kangaroo court scene, which had been deleted for many years.  Not only is that scene included in this DVD, but it is presented much more clearly, with much a better translation available.  Before, I'd thought that extra scene felt out of place, and now I know why;  it hadn't been handled properly.  Thanks to Criterion's amazing job completing this classic, its being shown that way it should be.",Positive
"The city of Berlin (during pre-WWII Germany) is wrought with hysteria as a cunning child-killer stalks the streets.  To hasten the capture of the murderer, the police clamp down tightly on local criminal activity, making business-as-usual activities nearly impossible for members of the city's organized-crime syndicate.  So in an effort to return the city to its previously permissive state of affairs, the local mobsters decide to hunt down the elusive homicidal pedophile themselves.This compelling study of a pedophilic serial killer and the public reaction to his odious crimes was decades ahead of its time in its treatment of psychological, political, and sociological themes.  The first ""talkie"" from pioneering auteur Fritz Lang--probably better known to fans of classic cinema as the director and artistic force behind 1927's groundbreaking, trendsetting silent SF classic METROPOLIS--1931's M is more than just a crime thriller.  It is actually a subtle comment on the sense of security that modern ""civilized"" people so blithely accept.  Lang so effectively blurs the line separating institutions of law from crime syndicates that he leaves viewers questioning whether or not society's leaders are actually capable of keeping its citizens safe and secure.  And indeed, Lang had good reason to pose such a question, as the Nazis were already on the rise in Germany at the time he was making M.  The film barely veils Lang's disgust for the Germany of that period--a Germany that could birth and foster a philosophy of hatred like Nazism--since the Berlin he depicts is dark with dirt and grime and the people all seem to have bloated, gnarly faces that are twisted into perpetual scowls.  That being the case, it is no surprise to learn that Lang employed actual Berlin residents and real-life members of the city's criminal underground to fill several supporting roles.M is also notable as the film that launched Peter Lorre into the international spotlight.  Lorre's gutwrenchingly emotive portrayal of a human monster who is unable to control his evil, deviant sexual impulses is nothing short of stellar.  Unfortunately, this performance also resulted in his being typecast, and it was afterwards difficult for him to secure roles outside of the noir or horror genres, even after his emigration to Hollywood.Released the same year as Tod Browning's classic Lugosi vehicle, DRACULA, M is actually the scarier of the two.  Although Lang's intention was for M to reflect the decaying and diseased society that WAS Germany during the years that culminated with World War II, it reflects just as poignantly the anger, violence, and social ambiguity so prevalent in today's world.  And that is very frightening indeed.The Criterion Collection DVD offers a visually stunning restored version of M in its original 1.33:1 aspect ratio and at its original 111-minute running time.  The disc plays the film with the original German-language soundtrack, but optional English subtitles are available.  Unlike many Criterion discs, there are no additional bonus features, but the opportunity to watch this remarkable and historic film as its legendary director intended makes amazon.com's less-than-suggested-retail price very reasonable.  Definitely a must-see for students of cinema, aficionados of classic films, and fans of the noir or thriller genres.",Positive
"Gotta say - this is a great filmPersonally - aside from the set design - I wasn't crazy about Metropolis, so I didn't know what to expect with this piece of Lang'sHowever, this was an excellent film --- obviously, nothing can compete with Metropolis's set design....... however, this film had an amazing and powerful story attached to it, that is likely going to grab EVERYONE!!!!!I don't wanna give it away, but its a highly political one, that leaves no one without criticismIf Fritz were alive today, I'd be willing to bet that he would be running for President on the Liberterian ticket",Positive
"Released in 1931 by independent production company Nero Films, at the height of director Fritz Lang's career in Germany, ""M"" was Lang's first sound film and is second in renown only to his 1927 film ""Metropolis"". A serial child-killer who may have abducted and murdered as many as 8 little girls is on the loose in a German city. Citizens have become cautious, paranoid, wary of innocent conversations, suspicious of strangers, and quick to accuse anyone at the slightest provocation. The police have looked under every rock, combed through every blade of grass, arrested every miscreant with no consequence except an exhausted and overworked police force. The criminal underworld, frustrated by the constant police raids and resulting loss of income, decide that the only solution is to find the killer themselves. So two simultaneous manhunts ensue, one by the police and one by the criminals.Because this was his first ""talkie"", ""M"" was also the first film that Fritz Lang did not edit himself. Editor Paul Falkenberg does a great job of cross-cutting between the police and underworld strategy meetings and of letting Hans Beckett's pathetic speech before the kangaroo court run. The editing really makes those scenes memorable. Comparing this edit of ""M"" to some of the other, choppier versions that were released over the years highlights Falkenberg's good judgment. The criminals' ""kangaroo court"" is a powerful sight, and it gives actor Peter Lorre the opportunity to define Hans Beckett late in the film. Lang used real members of the Berlin underworld as extras and was forced to get his footage in time for them to elude the cops, who had been tipped off.  The tune that Hans Beckett whistles was actually whistled by scriptwriter Thea von Harbou, Fritz Lang's wife at the time, by the way. To Lang's irritation, Peter Lorre could not whistle.""M"" is often cited as the first film in which a monstrous criminal was portrayed in a sympathetic light, as a feeling person compelled by an almost irrestible compulsion. But what Fritz Lang was trying to say in ""M"", if anything, has long been the subject of debate. The debate took on political significance in Nazi Germany. Nazi Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels admired ""M"" because it advocated the death penalty, but ""M"" was later used in an anti-Jewish propaganda film accusing Peter Lorre of trying to create sympathy for child-murders with his portrayal of Hans Beckman. Fritz Lang did advocate the death penalty and, in interviews, didn't seem to agree that Beckman was depicted sympathetically, so I don't think ""M"" was intended in the way it is often taken today. It may be unlikely that a film would be received in the spirit it was made 75 years later and several cultures apart. But today's viewers either find Hans Beckman sympathetic or they do not, just like audiences in 1931.The DVDs (Criterion Collection 2004 2-disc set): There have been many different edits of ""M"" over the years, initially on account of language difficulties in distributing the film outside of Germany. This 111-minute version of the film is as close to Fritz Lang's original as we will ever get, barring the discovery of earlier prints, which editor Paul Falkenberg says contained a few more scenes. This transfer retains the film's original aspect ratio, the short-lived 1.19:1, so it is pillarboxed, meaning that there are thin black bars on the sides of the screen (the opposite of letterboxing). The print has been restored, with major flaws removed, but there are still white specks and lines in a few scenes. Sound is good. The film is in German with optional English subtitles.All bonus features are on Disc 2: ""Conversation with Fritz Lang"" (48 min) is a 1975 interview filmed by director William Friedkin. Lang recalls his time in Brussels and the beginning of his film career in Vienna, 1917-1918. He talks about ""Metropolis"", ""M"", and recounts the famous story of Goebbels alleged offer that he head the German film industry and Lang's subsequent departure to Paris. ""Claude Chabrol's 'M le Maudit'"" (11 min) is a condensed version of ""M"" made for the French television program ""Cin&eacute;-Parade"" in 1982. A useless exercise really. ""Harold Nebenzal Interview"" (14 min) is an interesting 2004 conversation with the son of ""M"" producer Seymour Nebenzal about his family's pioneering independent film studio Nero Films and recollections of Fritz Lang. ""Peter Falkenberg's Classroom Tapes"" (35 min) are excerpts of Falkenberg's lectures about ""M"" at The New School University in New York, 1976-1977. He talks about filming and editing ""M"" as we watch the first half-hour of the film, taking questions from students, and then it jumps to the final scene. ""A Physical History of M"" (25 min) is about the restoration and all the ""chopping, splicing, and reworking"" that created so many different versions of the film since 1931. We see examples of those versions that sometimes called for re-shoots and dubbing as well as re-editing. ""Stills Gallery"" includes production stills, behind-the-scenes photos, and production sketches by art director Emil Hasler. English subtitles for the film clips are optional.",Positive
"Some critics/historians believe ""M"" to be an early look at film noir.  It really doesn't lend itself to that genre.  There is no detective in the formative lead.  The primary focus is on Peter Lorre as Franz Becker, a pedophile in Berlin.  Young girls are disappearing and the police have few clues.  The movie takes great pains to show the effort the police are taking; following up on leads, checking finger prints, finding candy stores from scraps of paper found in a park.  The great Fritz Lang directed and co-wrote along with his wife Thea von Harbou.  The story isn't really a who-done-it as we learn the identity of culprit early on, but focuses on the capture and the why is he committing such horrible crimes.  As the cops put on their full court press to flush out the killer, they begin to interfere with the lives of the petty criminals.  The pimps, prostitutes, thieves, pick-pockets and other scallywags are put upon.  The mob boss concludes they must find the killer themselves to remove the police pressure.  They are successful thanks to a blind balloon salesmen and a creative young street urchin.  The young man manages to identify the pervert by chalking his overcoat with the letter ""M"" for murderer.  After capturing Becker, the mobster chief, Schraenker heads a kangaroo court to try him for his crimes.  Lorre puts on a believable if over-the-top performance to express his mental instability.  That is, he can't help himself.  There is an inner force that changes his personality.  This is an early film look at an insanity defense.  As he is about to be sentenced, the film jumps quickly to a real court as the gavel comes down.  The mob has turned Becker over to the cops.  Technically the film is well made and Criterion has done a superb job of restoration including displaying the unusual 1:19 to 1 aspect ratio.",Positive
"what makes a man kill young children?even he himself doesn't know!we look with hatred at the killer when he lures young children. but when he's chased down and caught by a vengeful mob, his terror makes us pity him. even more his helplessness against his own perversion.he knows that what he is doing is wrong. but he can't help it.similar to drug addicts who can't help themselves from getting deeper into their addiction.beautifully done movie which brings out the enigma of human nature. brilliant performance by the lead actor.",Positive
"Ok... in my book, you can't miss any film that has the great Peter Lorre in a key role. While this film was most likely intended to make a statement about society, it translates nicely as a finely crafted story of a manhunt for a despicable murderer of children.The Criterion dvd features a very nice print, and considering this is in the early day of sound film, maintains a clean soundtrack.Like the best of post WWI German films, M makes people look at themselves and question the power that leads, or misleads. The gray area is surprisingly broad when presented in such a skilled way. This film merits re-watching as the arguement proposed in M leaves further questions, rather than answers.The sharp editing and stark imagery make the technical execution of this film a classic and paints society itself as ugly as its own nightmares.",Positive
"There are so many cinematic gems from the first half of the 20th century that are hidden under piles of dust. It is unfortunate that many have been largely forgotten. The good news is that I do not foresee the same fate for M. Filmed in 1931, M still entertains and keeps viewers on the edge of their seats generations later. The elaborate steps through which good guys and bad guys alike must keep watch for the man who has already killed 8 children was thoroughly engaging. And the irony of crooks bringing a criminal to justice was beautiful.I grew up with Peter Lorre being nothing more than an occasional guest spot in a Looney Tunes Cartoon. I had no idea who this man was with these signature puppy-dog eyes and this voice you wouldn't let read to your kids at night. I had no idea he made movies until I was older. I began to see his name associated with certain movies that were well before my time. I heard stories and read snippets about him that praised his body of work. Before M I had seen him support such great leads as Humphrey Bogart and Daffy Duck. It wasn't until M that I experienced first hand how good Peter Lorre was. He spends most of the movie nearly silent. I was nearly confused by why his name was so prominently displayed on the DVD, though he had such a quiet role. And then the movie began to draw to a close and as it did its pace quickened and Peter Lorre came out of his shell.I really enjoyed M.",Positive
"This is an astounding film. Peter Lorre gives a hauntingly brilliant performance as the twisted, yet sympathetic serial killer loosely based on real-life serial killers of the time (Fritz Haarman &amp; Peter Kurten). A serial killer is on the loose preying on little children. The police can't figure out who it is. The criminals who are sickened by the news decide to band together to track down the killer. Fritz lang does a brilliant job conveying the sheer terror that gripped the town as a monster roams the streets killing innocent children. A classic that deserves mentioning as one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.",Positive
"Fritz Lang's M features a young Peter Lorre as a psychotic child murderer on the loose in Germany. His performance is chilling. The rest of the cast is also excellent as they portray various levels of society reacting to the murders and participating in the hunt for a serial killer. Lang uses music and lighting to great effect and the film is gripping from beginning to end. It is in B&W with English subtitles. For lovers of classic films this is a must see. It showcases a master at work in the creation of an atmospheric horror story with minimal technology and special effects.  You can honestly say after watching this "" they don't make them like this anymore"".",Positive
"M is an extremely impressive movie...but very difficult to review.  Part of what is so compelling about this early talkie from 1931 is how MODERN much of it feels.  And is it really fair to give a movie points for simply surprising the viewer with how similar the plot feels to serial killer movies of today?However one might come down on that subject, I can't deny that this is a fascinating experience...made truly memorably by Peter Lorre's spectacular (and spectacularly over-the-top) performance as a psychopath before that genre was even remotely familiar.  He had no prior performances to draw from or reference.Lorre plays the normal (okay, slightly odd, but mostly normal) neighbor who ""kept to himself...I never saw this coming.""  He is a killer of children.  He lures them on the streets with bon-bons or balloons and then they disappear...until their corpses are found later.  Although the film never explicitly mentions sexual abuse...it is deeply implied.M spends much of its time focusing on the investigation into these serial killings.  We literally have law-enforcement authorities talking to each other on the phone and detailing all the efforts they are making.  It's fascinating, because in the days LONG before computers or any tech gadgetry...these policemen undertake a painstaking and organized search for evidence throughout their German city.  What they lack in whiz-bang technology, they make up for in sheer numbers, determination and German precision.  And they REALLY put the squeeze on the criminal element of the city.  And this has a fascinating result of galvanizing the BAD guys into looking for this killer as well.  Not from altruism, but self-preservation.  This big search for a child killer is putting a damper on their business.So M is a serial killer movie, but truthfully most of it is more like a police procedural.  There are some pretty intense scenes as they get closer to their quarry...for such seemingly formal and dry material, the brilliant director Fritz Lang conjures up some real tension.  And when we do get to spend time with Lorre and the demons that plaque him begin to surface...well, the film becomes downright creepy.  Lorre throws himself into his role and his gigantic monologue is a bit overdone (it's more suited for stage than screen...but this was such a problem in those days), but it is also riveting and truly memorable.I think the best way I can articulate my thoughts about the film is to say that it really wasn't much like I expected it to be...it was better.  Lang is a master of mood and lighting.  Lorre is a perfect match of actor to role.  And both the psychology of the killer and the form of the police work make a great deal of sense.  You won't find yourself rolling your eyes at the primitiveness of it all...you'll be drawn in by much of the logic.  Not to say it's perfect...but it probably has no more holes than a typical episode of LAW AND ORDER.  I also felt the film was well paced, and even had a sly sense of humor at times.I watched the Criterion Blu-ray and it was excellent.  The black and white was gorgeous.  You'll note that many scenes lose their sound altogether.  Apparently, this was on purpose...so don't blame Criterion; blame Lang for a convention that feels odd.  Subtitles were sometimes hard to read.  I've seen several Criterion black and white films lately that have surprisingly shoddy subtitles.The bonus materials are NOT shoddy.  They are plentiful as usual, but my favorite was the English language ""redo"" of the film.  They took the German movie and refilmed scenes, dubbed others and generally did a butcher job.  I skipped most of it, but you MUST see Lorre recreate his famous monologue in English.  It's far less effective and a great argument for letting folks act in their native languages.So a great movie, presented with typical panache by Criterion (subtitling being a notable exception).  Of course, this is a film for film-buffs and my review is written with that understanding in mind.  I'm not sure what a more casual film fan might make of this.  I can envision them being fascinated or bored.  But if you've read this far, I'd say you're a film buff and this ought to go on your must-see list.",Positive
"M (Fritz Lang, 1931)It has been said that behind every crime story ever committed to film lies the shadow of M. That may well be true, though Lang (and others) were making crime dramas long before this (the first Dr. Mabuse movie was made nine years previous, for example). Still, there is a great deal here to warrant the speculation.Loosely based on the story of Fritz Haarmann, the Werewolf of Dusseldorf (whose story was also the basis for the more recent Tenderness of the Wolves), M is the story of a child murderer, Franz Becker (the screen debut of the astonishing Peter Lorre), and the simultaneous attempts by the police and a crime syndicate to track him down. The suspense builds quickly (perhaps too quickly; the restored version, released in 2000, is almost twenty minutes shorter than Lang's original theatrical release) as Becker tries to evade both the law and the criminals while plying his trade.The film might have been a simple crime thriller, above average but not really rising head and shoulders above the crowd (in the same way, for example, Hitchcock's The Thirty-Nine Steps is enjoyable, but it's not Psycho or North by Northwest) but for one thing: Peter Lorre. He almost sleepwalks through the first three-quarters of the film in an air of perfect menace, uttering perhaps three lines throughout. Then, in the final quarter, when pressed to the wall, he unleashes a stream of monologues so perfectly acted and inexpressibly brilliant that the viewer can do nothing but stand in awe of Lorre's power to both act like a man in fear of his life and engender the sympathies of film viewers everywhere at the same time, despite our knowledge of his guilt. (As a side note, this is one of the many differences between Franz Becker and Fritz Haarmann; the latter was quite happy to die, at anyone's hands, instead of going back to an insane asylum. He protested not at all on his own behalf, after his capture.)It might also be said that behind every criminal trial since also lies the shadow of M, as the contents of Lorre's monologues are now standard defenses in criminal trials around the world every day. But try not to hold that against this compelling, awe-inspiring film. ****",Positive
"M is the story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre), a man who walks the streets and lures children to him through candy and balloons. Soon, the whole town is in fear of their children's lives, so they follow them around like mad. The trouble is, the criminals are being watched more closely now too, so it is difficult for them to earn their living (albiet in a less-than-moral way). They band together to catch the criminal, and take him to their own court to render a verdict.There are some points when the early sound technology causes this film to suffer, but director Fritz Lang does a great job of getting around some of the restrictions. Instead of allowing the camera to become stagnant, he shoots the scenes as silent scenes and then dubs in the dialogue later. This is not noticable because there are no close-ups on faces; there are no lips moving out of sequence with the sound. There are times when there is no sound at all, and then it is broken by piercing noises. This makes them more noticable and jarring, although one might be drawn out of the movie by the initial silence.There are some great scenes, though. One involves cutting from the criminals creating a strategy to catch the murderer to the police doing the same. Lang uses the Peer Gynt Suite to illustrate a scene where the murderer tries to lure another child to him. There are some great overhead shots as well. At the trial, Lang films actors facing the camera directly, which creates a claustrophobic feeling. Although no violence is shown, and nothing is explained in great detail, the construction of the film is so good that this movie's subject will disturb you just the same. Credit must be given to Lorre whose performance is very powerful.",Positive
"[This review is for the single DVD Criterion Collection]I really wanted one of Fritz Lang's first ""talkies"" and as I do enjoy Peter Lorre (and here, in one of his first appearances) I had to get ""M.""""M"" deals with several themes:  A child murderer, two groups both out to get him (one, criminal -- the other, the police) and as well the terror in the streets.The luring of the child to her doom is not easy to watch, although done tastefully for use of a better word.  You hear no scream.  Just a bouncing ball that stops, a balloon toy recently purchased now caught in the phone lines.  Pretty creepy.Peter Lorre plays the child murderer and finds himself before a kangaroo court made of thieves and murderers that want justice and his head!  As I said, several themes:  Is a man guilty of murder if he ""can't help it"" and the voices in his head tell him to?  The thieves have one thought:  let him go to the asylum, he gets out after being declared harmless and does it again!  Is mob justice just?Is the insanity defense proper?And finally, the torture parents go through at the loss and/or death of their child, though this is touched on only briefly.The only counterpoint on this tale is the slow-moving committees that are set up:  this film is quite talkative in the first third and I felt that really dragged the film.The film is quite thought-provoking and is a msut-see for film students and murder mystery fans!DVD:My DVD was from the Criterion Collection and did not have any features.  You can change the subtitles and even make color bars for your TV, but alas no trailers and no discussions or commentaries.Other Noteworthy Films from Fritz Lang:The Complete MetropolisM - 2 Disc Special Edition - (The Criterion Collection)Woman In the Moon",Positive
"A harrowing melodrama about a psychotic child murderer who's brought to justice by the Berlin underworld. Lorre's performance is unforgettable in this riveting and frightening film which is surprisingly cinematically  dazzling for an early talkie. An unmistakable classic whose oddities are  trivial; brilliantly staged, this film is part social melodrama and part  satire and its got visual excitement, pace, brilliance of surface and  feeling for detail.",Positive
"When discussing the merits of a ""classic"" film, it's almost heresy to point out that not every movie-goer is a budding film historian or critic.  Students of ""film"" rave about Fritz Lang's ""M"" for its innovative camera work, semi-scandalous subject matter, and perhaps most of all, the casting of film legend Peter Lorre in his first film as the legendary serial killer of children.There is an awful lot in ""M"" that holds up, even after the passing of 75 years.  The use of seemingly-innocent images to suggest murder, the twisting of the ""Peer Gynt Suite"" into a dark melody of terror, the inter-changing shots of the police and criminal gangs tracking down the murderer, and the ambiguous, ominous ending all seem fresh and new.  Peter Lorre's performance was one for the ages, and you can see the germ of so many of his later creepy characters in his pathetic killer.But to be honest, there is a lot in ""M"" that will turn off the casual movie fan.  For one, this is one of the first ""talkie"" movies, so the sound quality is not very good - even by German standards, voices are often harsh and clipped.  There's also quite a bit of damage to the film, so there are quite a few hiccups in the film, and there's a white bar across the top of the screen for a major chunk of the movie.  Again, when you appreciate what ""M"" is in film terms, that's not so bad, but it will be enough (as I can attest from personal experience showing ""M"" to friends) to turn off the occasional casual movie fan.The DVD is excellent, with high-quality sub-titles and a good recapture of the restored film.  Someone needs to explain to my why ""Color Bars"" are a special feature on the DVD, however.To my mind, ""M"" is an amazing film.  But it helps to understand its place in film history to enjoy it, and unfortunately not everyone is a major-league cinemaphile.  Check it out, but be wary of showing it to your friends if they aren't die-hard film buffs - they may think you've lost it.",Positive
Some film historics consider it the best film maybe ever done in Germany.  Watch the old an decadent Berlin (rare like in &quot;Emil and the  detectives&quot;). It will never be the same city again later. Peter Lorre  and Gustav Gr&uuml;ndgens as Lang are genious. Fritz Lang has the sensibility of  feeling the dark and light both;  like the german forests  5000 years ago:  combining his understanding for dark pleasures as his love for any human on  earth.,Positive
"This is without hyperbole one of the best movies ever made.  When I first watched it, I was absolutely riveted.  While German cinema of this time period (1920s-1930s) was certainly edgy, experimental and deeply rooted in the social issues of the day, this movie stands above the rest.  It's one of the very first movies to examine the social problems of serial killers, pedophiles, mental illness and mob rule.  And all of this is delivered with Fritz Lang's incomparable film-making style.The newest Criterion release is definitely the best available.  Not only does the film look lovely with its new transfer, but there are plenty of informative extras to keep Lang's most ardent fans happy.",Positive
"M - Regarded by many as the greatest German film ever, the subject of a number of books and many articles, a review from this corner seems superfluous, if not pretentious.  Let me leave it with a few impressions.  For a classic, M is very entertaining, especially if you're a action/thriller fan.  A very young, pudgy Peter Lorre is a revelation in the role of the child murderer, and rightly became an international star subsequently. The print, restored and preserved in 2001, is very good.Commentary - Anton Kaes and Eric Rentschler seem to know M backwards and forward, and provide a lot of information, the bulk of which deals with visual and thematic motifs.  As a plus, they seem to have recorded the commentary together.Conversation with Fritz Lang - recorded in 1975 with director William Friedkin, when Lang was 85 (he died in 1976.)  Provides his version of his meeting with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, which is a subject of academic dispute.  Also interesting for his response to Friedkin's observation that he portrayed the child murderer in M as a sympathetic character.  Interesting because a later special feature will make the same point, decidedly less sympathetically, in one of their anti-Semitic propaganda films.Claude Chabrol's M - A weird little six-minute film.  Seems the French were giving the Readers Digest condensed treatment to classic films in the `60s.  Includes a short interview with Chabrol discussing Lang's directorial techniques.M editor Paul Falkenberg - Thirty odd year old audio tape with video images of the film.  Falkenberg discusses M with an editing class.Harold Nebenzal interview - So-so interview with son of M's producer Seymour Nebenzal.Physical History of M - About twenty minutes worth of material.  Some interesting scenes of Lorre's French version of his famous trial scene.  Also contains extended scenes from DER EWIGE JUDE (The Eternal Jew), a vicious Nazi propaganda film from 1940 that used clips from M as examples of Jewish depravity.Stills gallery - Typical behind the scenes, promotional stuff.",Positive
"This is Fritz Lang's best. Its not like Metropolis but its worth a viewing! Great performance by Peter Loore, excellent cinematography, beautiful and artistic plot line.",Positive
"This film breathes with the gritty textures and desperation of post-war Germany, people living in the stark and dank aftermath of profound economic and personal depression. I almost felt like I was sleepwalking through someone else's nightmare. That ultimate nightmare where time drags through the surreal streets of utter abstract madness. A madness of people, who would otherwise be civil and respectful to one another, all on the brink of absolute hopelessness steeped in a most fragile sanity, unmasking their most base and animalistic instincts with every new situation and fear.'M' is much more than the murder of children. It is much more than the story of a murderer. It's really an indictment against 'humanity's' illusion that human beings, the chosen and godly creation made in the image of God, are above the most base instincts of immediate self-preservation when confronted with hunger, fear and survival.We see how easily human beings turn into a lynch mob when confronted with the unspoken fears that darkly reveal the other, hidden side of human nature. Where I know you because I know me, and that scares me to death. For if your fears and prejudices and unresolved angst and frustrations are as deep-rooted and horrific as mine, then I'm definately not turning my back on you. I'm not even going to let you out of my sight.This is the paranoia running through the veins and skin within every human being. This is the atmosphere and reality running through this film. This is the message we each need to learn if we are to survive not only the world we all share together, but if one is to learn how to live peacefully and productively within one's skin. This is the message of quiet desperation mixed with a fragile sanity that this film conveyed to me.",Positive
"With his bugging eyes, lingering baby fat and perfectly round head, Peter Lorre's face has become something of an unexpected icon.  Lorre's visage is such a strange molding that it has even become enshrined in a number of cartoons: Warner Bros. used his impression in a classic Daffy Duck cartoon, the Genie in Disney's Aladdin concocted a Peter Lorre impression and a worm featured in the stop-motion film Corpse Bride bore a striking resemblance to the classic actor.  Most of these representations of Lorre played up the creepy nature of his image.  It should surprise no one, then, that Lorre's first role was as a pedophile and serial killer in the Fitz Lang directed M.Many film critics credit Lorre's character in M as the first serial killer in cinematic history, a dubious, if somehow unsurprising honor.  The film itself is less interested in the motivations of the serial killer, although they are touched upon, than in how his reign affects the citizens of the unnamed German city.  There is no single main character in the film, leading one to suspect that Lang was interested in the living, breathing life of the city itself rather than a single stalwart investigator.  Just as the M is the first serial killer film, it is also likely one of the first police procedurals.Lang beautifully illustrates how the threat of this serial killer has upended the lives of the citizens, police and criminals alike.  In the first scene we hear a chorus of children singing a makeshift nursery rhyme about the killings (a technique that has been copied many times since, most famously in Nightmare on Elm Street).  Even as one mother complains about the grisly song, another comments that when they can hear their children singing, at least they know they're still alive.  The police have been chasing after the killer for months, but, as the police chief explains to a politician over the phone, the murderer has left no clues and any tips have turned out to be worthless.  These murders have even hurt the criminal element of the city.  As the police have increased their efforts to find the killer, they have also increased pressure on criminal establishments.  In order to rid themselves of the law, the gangs have decided that they must first get rid of this killer.These stories are woven together through several strategically employed film techniques.  When both the police and the gangs lay out their plan for capturing the murderer, Lang deftly cuts back and forth between them.  It becomes a race between the law and the criminals to find the killer first.  Cutting-edge camera work further helps draw a line between many different characters who have little in common beyond their fearful reaction to the killer.  Lang's camera deftly movies around buildings and through windows, connecting disparate city space.  M becomes much more than a story about a serial killer, but rather becomes how fear breeds in an urban environment.There are few modern corollaries to M.  The closest example in film might be David Fincher's Zodiac, another film about a serial killer that is more concerned with those trying to capture the criminal than the criminal himself.  However, the movie's diffuse focus, its cast of dozens and its curiosity about the detailed workings of a city is also reminiscent of many HBO television shows of the last decade or so, especially The Wire.  It's become something of a clich&eacute; to say ""they don't make them like they used to,"" so instead I'll merely suggest that they're still trying to make them like they once did.",Positive
"M being Fritz Lang's other classic apart from Metropolis. At times it was a bit unnerving to not have any soundtrack. There are times where there is dead silence. This was one of the first major movies to depict a child serial killer (we are not shown that he is a pedophile except that  he kills them). The serial killer is at large and the police department is unable to nab him and stop his spate of killings. The killer writes to the press taunting the police of his skill at eluding the cops. He warns of future killings. The movie is probably the first movie which tries to bring in forensics and cartographical analysis into mainstream films.The Police finds that the killer is too clever and never leaves clues. The police in the process of having a tighter vigil and look out for the killer disrupts the underworld business. These underworld criminals who run casinos and brothels are often raided by police in an attempt to nab the possible serial killer. The underworld being harrassed by the police and facing financial loses due to the disruption of their business and being the subject of tighter scrutiny of the police, take it upon themselves to capture and kill the serial killer. I just felt that the movie could have upped the dramatic impact a few notches highet if there had been a score to the film. Many parts of the film call for dramatic scoring which would have worked well. In any case it was a good film, but in this day and age, when we are subject to so many violent whodunnits,  we may find the movie a touch tame and simplistic. This is a German film with subtitles.regards, Vikram",Positive
"spoilers.This is a great story of an entire city going crazy with fear over a child killer, played well by Peter Lorre, and in the end, a group of vigilantes tries to dispense justice in their own fashion.It's fascinating to watch the accused insist on his own dark compulsion and claim that he does not remember committing the murders.  Apparently the insanity plea goes back a long way.He even begs to get the police involved so that he can at least get a fair trial, which the criminals were not willing to give him.There is certainly some over-emoting on the part of the actors, but this was quite common in the early days of talkies, when people were still in the habit of exaggerating everything for silent film work.Good stuff!",Positive
All the reviews I've read here are so good that all I can add is the image of the balloon floating in the air.,Positive
"The success of the immensly popular kids show ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" lead, of course, to a live-action movie. Obviuosly most of theater flockers would be the millions of saturday morning kiddies who love  the cartoon, but the producers didn't want to forget those whose support of  the original grittier version of TMNT (in the b&w comix) that spawned  the toys and the cartoon in the 1st place. So they decided to mesh the two.  (Aside from new characters created exclusively for the film) only  characters from the original comix were used: the TMNT, Shredder, April,  Casey, Splinter. No Krang, Technodrome, Dimension X, Rocksteady & Bebop  or footbots. (However April is still a reporter though.) But it was done in  the style of the cartoon; lots of joking around, lots of pizza munching and  even multi-colored bandanas and pupils were given to the turtles. But none of  it is done to the point where a fan of the comix couldn't stand it,  actually most of it is quite funny. The plot was even based upon the  original comix following TMNT vol. 1 #1, Raphael #1 (loosely), Leonardo #1  (very loosely), TMNT #10, 11 and 19-21 (Return to New York). Of course some  editing is done to adapt all of these comix into a 100m film and I must say it's done quite well, still us true TMNT fans await a cartoon or film adaptation based ONLY upon the original comix, but hey this is good too.  Also, Jim Henson's Turtle costumes were wonderful.",Positive
"Loved this movie as a kid and still do now. A remake would be awesome. Is a great 80's movie. About new York, chrome and its unusual crime fighters. If you have never see this movie, its a great movie for the kids and family.",Positive
"If there ever was a movie to define early 90's Americana, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles would definelty be the prime choice. Almost 12 WHOLE YEARS after it's release date, a movie that was geared at kids is STILL entertaining! Can Power Rangers do that? NO! Can Pokemon do that? HECK NO! No one beats the Ninja Turtles. Ninja Turtles, the Original Movie is hands down the best of the trilogy (Who really care about #4 anyways?). The humor in here is great and even though you get such morbid visions as Shredder being crushed by a garbage truck, there is still an underlying message about ""teamwork"" and all that corny horse.... Raphael was awesome as the outcast who went against everyone else. Michaelangelo and Donatello provided the comic relief and Leonardo was the pretentious leader. All the characters in this movie are different and have their own personalities, which is something no. 3 was lacking. If you want some harmless, no-brainer fun, rent or BUY this movie now! Don't listen to Leonard Maltin, he's just too jaded to enjoy movies like this. ""I made a funny!""",Positive
"This movie as an absolute masterpiece and triumph of filmmaking.  New Line Cinema did the seemingly impossible; it took a beloved cartoon series and turned it into one of the greatest films of all time.  This movie fires on all cylinders; the writing, acting, and dialogue are as good as it gets.  The scenes of Splinter learning Ninjitsu in his cage are nothing short of breathtaking.  This is nothing short of a piece of art, and a masterpiece at that.",Positive
"15 years ago, four baby turtles and a rat met with some ooze that turned them into mutants.  These four brothers are known as: Michelangelo,Leonardo, Dontello and Rafeal (spelling?)These four turtles are heroes on a half shell.  They fight the evil Shedder, who is known by Splinter in some way.A good movie!",Positive
"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles the (1990) Original film!! Damn I Love this movie!! and never get bored of it!! this movie came out when i was born, and i didn't see it till i was 6 and fell in love with it instantly, call it Love at first sight but damn this movie was action packed! Hilarious!! and Awesome!! I'm 22 now and still have a kick azz time with this film, a very cool movie and for it's time back then it's a huge success. So for any new kid wondering if it's worth watching, it is!! It's time to kick butt with turtles and enjoy pizza!!!! Cowabunga dude's!!!!! Go ninja! go ninja! GO!!!!!!!",Positive
"How can you not like this movie? This movie was not meant to be a serious drama or not even a hardcore action movie...it was meant to be fun! Once that is in your mind, you will thouroghly enjoy this movie that made history with its live action characters. If you were a little kid  when this movie came out, you did not care about little things like the plot or the script. And for grown-ups, the movie awakened the little child in all of us and we found ourselves remembering the days of yesteryear, when we were watching Saturday morning cartoons, rooting for the good guys to kick the bad guys butts.  The movie is good, so if you don't take this movie too seriously, you will enjoy it. The way the live action characters interact with their environment is really something. The turtles are a brilliant creation of Jim Henson, whose legacy still lives. If you are in the mood to just enjoy a simpler movie without all the expensive special  effects, go watch this movie and forget about your troubles for about 90 minutes.",Positive
"I'll admit that I was at first only a reluctant fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoons back in the late 80's and early 90's, if for no other reason than I was pretty much forced to watch it by the simple fact that my brother and sister both watched it while they babysat me. But as time got on I did grow to genuinely enjoy the series. I mean, who can watch the show and not laugh at the bumbling antics of Shredder and his goons as they try to gain the advantage against the turtles? So when I heard that a TMNT movie was in the works (it came out as I recall in the summer of my tenth year back in 1990), I was at least willing to give it a whirl.It should be noted that in quite a few important ways the movie is as unlike to the cartoon as night from day. The actors aren't even the same, for one thing. Not that this detracted from my enjoyment of the film or its two sequels, it didn't. But certain elements of the characters' past, Splinter and Shredder's in particular, were altered, more I think to be more true to the comics than anything. Splinter goes from being the mutated form of a Ninja warrior named Hamato Yoshi to being the pet of said Ninja. Raphael, who in the cartoon was always the wsecracker of the group, becomes a much more solitary, angry character often given to acts of rashness that nearly cost him his life. This behavior almost creates a rift in the turtles at one point, but they reunite in an effort to save their beloved master from Shredder. There's another character much changed from his cartoon persona. Gone is the often petulant, whiny villain, to be replaced by a sinister and ruthless criminal mastermind with an ominous voice. In short he changes from someone to be laughed at to a man to avoid at any cost.All in all I was very impressed with the movies. I only wish I still had my VHS copies, but then again I so rarely watch those anymore that it seemed more advisable to get them on DVD, which I intend to do next month if finances permit. So if you haven't already seen them, pop on over to your local video rental and pick up the three TMNT films. I personally liked the first one best, but Secret of the Ooz was close behind. The third one took a bit of getting used to but I eventually did conclude that I liked it just as much as the others.",Positive
"I watched this over and over with my son when he was little. Now I have a little granddaughter and she loves it too. This is a very fun movie. Karate kicking, pizza eating turtle boys are probably not the best influence but they are sweet (even Raf in his way) and well intentioned with a strong sense of right and wrong. Shredder is scary and bad but try to find a movie without an antagonist. And at the end of the day parents are a far bigger influence than any movie is ever gonna be.",Positive
"This is such a fun movie.  Got you drama and your humor.  TMNT is a classic movie.  Well-balanced between the comic versions and cartoon versions helped for this film to appeal to all turlte afficianados.Not too much extra on this DVD.  The mini-game, one you can actually play on ANY DVD, is a nice innovative touch, although it can not amuse too long.",Positive
"Unless you've spent the last 20-odd years in a cave in the Himalayas, you probably have some familiarity with the TMNT, as the marketing gurus call them.  But you don't have to have played the video game, read the comics, or watched the TV series to enjoy this big-screen version of the adventures of Michaelangelo (voiced by Robbie Rist), Donatello (Corey Feldman), Leonardo (Brian Tochi), and quick-tempered Raphael (Josh Pais), transformed by a mysterious glowing liquid into sentient human-size youngsters and trained in the secret arts of the ninja by Splinter (Kevin Clash), the likewise mutated rat who learned them by watching his former master, one of Japan's foremost experts.  Dwelling in the sewers under the Manhattan streets, the quartet save a TV reporter named April O'Neill (Judith Hoag) from what appears at first to be ordinary juvenile delinquents, but soon discover that they've landed feet first in the affairs of the mysterious Foot Clan, headed by the sinister Shredder (James Saito) and his glowering lieutenant Tatsu (Toshiro Obato).  Meanwhile April's boss (Jay Patterson), all unawares, is harboring a Foot fighter in his own home, in the person of his rebellious teenage son Danny (Michael Turney), and a former pro hockey player, Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), is reinventing himself as a crime-fighting vigilante as well.  Most critics seem to think the story isn't anything to write home about, but if you look at it closely you see that it's not only a new twist on the Fagin motif fromOliver Twist (Unabridged Classics) (Sterling Classics), but a commentary on loyalty, youthful alienation, and the importance of finding your place in the world.  And, of course, the turtles themselves are delightful originals.  (The fight scenes are nothing to sneeze at either, and Shredder will appeal to anyone with a sneaking admiration for Darth Vader.)",Positive
"Easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The turtles, and especially Splinters costumes look terrific, and I love watching today,just as much as I did back then. I've had this movie on VHS for 15 years now, or since it came out on tape, so maybe 14. Its the oldest movie I have on tape. Not the oldest movie by year, but its the movie I had on tape the longest. And still do. I bought the dvd which is great but I'm so disappointed there are no extras. For a movie like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, you should definately have extras. Behind the scenes footage, bloopers, the making of it, retrospective, cast interveiws, commentary, by actors or director, this movie should have it all, and it doesn't. A special two disc edition of this would be the greatest thing ever! With all the extras I listed above of course. I loved Elias Koteas as Casey Jones. A wonderful actor. Classic movie, that unfortunately didn't get proper attention on dvd.",Positive
"Back in the day, I was a huge Turtles fan. From the cartoon to action figures and whatever Turtle-y stuff was out there, it was usually mine. Of course, like all successful franchises, it gets made into a movie. Spawning 2 sequels and a surprisingly good CGI feature outing, the original is still one of those kind of films where you can't figure out if you're laughing at what you used to like or if it's just actually a good movie. One of the most successful independent movies around, it's still a solid piece of entertainment.The city of New York has just been hit with a massive crime wave with reports of teenagers stealing anything and everything, as well as sightings of weird masked ninjas and thefts happening quite stealthily. News reporter April O'Neal has been making it her business to inform everyone which of course attracts unwanted attention. In come 4 mutated human-sized ninja turtles, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello and Michaelangelo who decide to take the fight to the ninjas, dubbed the Foot Clan and their leader, the Shredder. With the guidance of Splinter, the Turtles end up becoming New York's saviors from crime.Cliche story no? Except for the mutated turtles and rat part, this is pretty much a basic story but of course this is a kid's cartoon so don't expect much. It does have some emotional aspects to it, such as Raphael's bitterness/rivalry towards Leonardo and the groups love for Splinter. Is the script cheesy? Well of course, but that's kind of what makes it fun. It's kind of one of those films where it's largely supposed to be a fun romp and it's what you'd end up getting upon watching. What does become unintentionally funny though are the flashback scenes explaining the Turtles' mutation as well as Splinter's former master and his rival. Stylistically it's quite unique since it takes place against a black background but the puppeteering is so hilarious that it detracts a tad. But then again, Splinter is probably one of the best puppet characters around. Whether he beats Yoda though is another thing.So how does this work as a film? It's actually quite good and it rarely sags. The pacing just feels right, the humor is silly but humorous and you can tell it doesn't feel like a completely low-budget movie. Only issue I had was at times there was 80's sounding music and I felt like ""ugh, what an 80's movie"". Other times though the score was actually good and certain scenes benefited quite a bit from it. Does it have any issues? Well again, people might find it funny due to nostalgia and a kind of ""man, the stuff I used to love"" laughter while other times the costumes looked...odd, like you were way too constantly aware that real characters were talking to humans in suits and not mutated turtles. Of course, I'm reading too much into it.Ever buy a movie simply because it's been so long since you seen it? That's the case here for me. If you watched it way back when, it's nice to revisit.",Positive
"I was a big fan of the cartoon series, which my parents disliked with a passion, but I persuaded them to take me to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie at the theater back in 1990 (Writing this makes me feel old! lol!). Surprisingly, my parents liked the movie and its two sequels.The 1990 movie is the closest that resembles the comics, except for the part of April being a reporter. The costumes done by the Jim Henson Company are better looking than most CGI special effects that are used in most movies today. This was my first true introduction of Casey Jones, who was hardly used in the animated series (I'm not counting the 2003 series). The only thing I disliked was Shredder's costume as it looked to fake. The producers should have gave the designers a little bit more money for it.Overall, it is still one of my favorite movies from my childhood.",Positive
"I was three years old when I first saw this movie. I saw the cartoon and thought that the Ninja Turtles were so cool. I was like, ""Ninja Turtles, cool!"" I still remember the song... ""Hero's in a half-shell, Turtle Power! They're the world's most fearsome fighting teens...""Well, the movies, especially this one, are more closer to the original Mirage Studios comic books than they are the kids' show. But still, I thought it was cool and I still do. And when I saw it on DVD, I became ecstatic.But to be honest, the only people that would buy this DVD are the people who are about my age, to bring back the nostalgia of our late 80s to early 90s culture. I'm not kiddng, all the kids shows from that era are gone ... now. Power Rangers, which was cool when it first aired, can't get any worse than it is now. Under the Umbrella Tree, that funky Canadian show, I haven't seen it in years. Maybe they still show it in Canada, in which case I would have to take a plane there from the most farthest away place from there on this side of the border to see it. And the original TMNT cartoon isn't aired nation wide, and there are only a few lucky people that can see reruns on local stations.But at least these movies are being released on DVD, so we can remember the days of SNES and Genesis, and trying to memorize your multiplication tables.",Positive
"Thats what discribes this movie. This is one of the best movies out there. It has a good cast and the costumes are awesome. To bad they didn't do that with the hulk. The costumes make the turtles & Splinter more life like. This is ttruely an awesome movie. I love this movie. The only thing wrong with it is that they didn't stay true to the Origin of the TMNT. But it is still an awesome movie i recomend it.If you like this movie Check out,1. TMNT 2: The Secret Of The ooze2. TMNT 33. TMNT The orginal soundtrack to the movie",Positive
"I remember when I was a kid I wasn't crazy about this movie, despite being wholeheartedly into the TMNT phenomenon. It's pretty dark compared to the cartoons. However, looking back on it now, I can appreciate the movie more for what it was trying to do. The movie attempted to capture the spirit of the original Mirage TMNT comics.While the plot and dark tone probably weren't the greatest choice for a movie geared towards kids, for an adult it's actually quite deep. There's a lot of interesting stuff about finding family. Some of the scenes are classic and still stay fresh in my mind, particularly the moments of the turtles relaxing at April's summer house. It's a much better story than you'd expect from a kid's movie.The movie was made before the era of CGI graphics. I have mixed feelings about the giant rubber suits they used for the turtles. While they're outdated, the costume designers fit a decent amount of animation in the costumes. They work by and large. But they do look outdated. In short, if you think you can overlook the fact that the rubber suits might look a bit cheesy at times, then this movie will probably work for you. If you care a lot about special effects, then this movie will drive you nuts.Looking back, it's actually shocking how good this movie is. It's a lot more mature than any of the movies coming out today based on comic books, including The Avengers. If anything, I think this movie might have been ahead of its time. I'd love to see a remake with better turtles costumes.",Positive
"They just don't make movies (especially ones for children) like this anymore. I saw this in theaters fifteen years ago, and I loved it. I proudly paid only $5.00 for this during Wal-Mart's video liquidation sale last year. I've owned Turtles II and the sub-par III for ten years, but I never did have my favourite first one on tape until now. As for the DVD release: don't bother. DVDs scrath just as badly as CDs, and there's nothing that can protect you collection from careless younger siblings intent on taking your fragile CD and DVD collection. Plus, the street market allows you to find (on VHS) extra-violent fight scenes that originally earned the first Turtles movie a PG-13 rating. If you want information on this workprint you're missing out on, go to [...]",Positive
"I have to say i give the crew behind TMNT a lot of credit, dealing with the low budget they had, and able to create the wonderful costumes for the turtles. I'm not good with the names of the people in the costumes but i have to say, they are truly talented in the 3 movies in this series. This movie does seem to slow down in the middle of it, but the fight scenes are amazing. A lot of great directed shots by Steve Barron, this is probably one of his best. With the low budget they had, they were limited on set design, which is noticeable, do to the fact, that some of the shots are actually from New York, and the house that they are in after there first encounter with The Foot is a real house. As we can all tell, the costumes probably took a great deal of percentage out of the 13 million dollar budget. But overall, this movie is just plain fun, and great adventure.",Positive
"Growing up a fan of the TMNT, I of course saw the movie when it was first released.  The thing about this film watching it now that I am an adult; it's still a very fun movie to enjoy.I sat down recently with a few of my college buddies and we watched this film as we all grew up as fans of the cartoon.  All of us remembered watching it when we were little and we wanted to gain a new perspective of it.The movie is just down-right funny!  It truly is.  The character of Casey Jones just adds so much comic relief to the movie, and it gels perfectly.  Along with the humor is the basic premise that stays true to the cartoon version, but also delvs a bit deeper.  Here, we learn the true background of Splinter and just how exactly he relates to Shredder.Another thing I like about the film is the fact that each character got their own very unique personality.  Another reviewer described the turtles and their traits so I'll spare you that grief, but the character of April is also right up there.  I was very happy to see that the character of April was really her own person, separate from the turtles.  She knew when to stand up for herself and she knew when to lie low.If you're looking for a movie that has action, cheesyness, and humor; than this is it.  This is a movie you can enjoy no matter how old you are and believe me you'll be quoting it for days afterward!",Positive
"The comic book and cartoon heroes come to life.Back when this movie first came out I was like 5 or 6,so I loved the Ninja Turtles from watching the cartoon and having the action figures.The movie is still enjoyable,even though I am now 19.The characters were develped very well,and the movie does a good job introducing the story of how the turtles came what they are.Besides the turtles and splinter,there is also Casey Jones and the Shredder of course.The movie is dark,made where it can be appealing to adults as well as children.The DVD version of the film is pretty cool!The picture in nice quality,not grainy,and you have your choice of viewing it full screen or wide screen.The sound quality is pretty good too.A real bargain and a real treat for Turtle fans.",Positive
"SPOILERS FOLLOWThis is a very durable movie, which is doubly surprising when one considers its potentially campy premise.  With the voice talents of Corey Feldman, Josh Pais, and featuring Elias Koteas, it is surprisingly good.The story takes a fairly mature tone that helps it appeal to a much broader age range than one might initially suppose.  The storyline is inclusive and rich, encompassing uncompromising emotional and physical trials for the Turtles.  Judith Hoag is decent as April O'Neill, the newswoman who befriends the Turtles.  The Turtles themselves, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael, spring into three-dimensional being in an achievement of visual effects that was fairly jaw-dropping by 1990 standards and holds up well today.  Elias Koteas is perfect as Casey Jones, the hockey-loving antihero whose compassion and good heart compel him to side with the Turtles.  The screenplay invests fairly minor characters with genuine fascination.  The wayward Danny Pennington, the son of April's boss, is an incisive sympathetic character, a symbol of goodness gone wrong.  He humanizes the danger the Foot Clan, the movie's evil martial arts gang, poses.Also starring character actor James Saito as the Turtles' enemy Shredder, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is surprisingly solid.  The film is rated PG for mature language and themes, and for bloodless yet staunch violence.",Positive
"I remember when this movie came out - I was expecting to see something based entirely off the TV show (I wasn't aware of an original comic - most kids didn't). You know, Technodrome, Baxter Stockman, Rocksteady and Bebop, Nutrinos, Krang, stuff like that. This doesn't have any of it!Actually, I'm surpirsed this movie managed a PG. In today's time this would get a PG-13. The hidden night club really had me surprised. It never crossed my mind to see a kid my age playing pool and smoking a cigar! I also never expected the foot soldiers to be human.The movie has a mature overtone, with plenty of jokes and laughter to entertain both kids and adults! They did a great job with this movie - especially when they had limited ends. It seemed they could do a serious movie the way it SHOULD be, or they could do one  based off the cartoon that only kiddies would like. They combined the two flawlessly. The movie has a kind of 'realism' to it. It's still fiction of course, but it's still based in the real world. The turtles themselves aren't perfect like they are in the cartoon. They go through turmoil, fights, and they get their butts kicked just like the real world.I'll always like the strange palship that goes on between Michaelangelo and Donatello. I think the guy who really steals the show here is Casey Jones! That guy just kicks [...] all the way! After he's Wayne Grutskey on steroids!",Positive
"I pulled out my old tape last night, that my parents bought me when I was 8, almost 14 years ago.  The first movie I ever owned.  I can't believe it still plays, remarkably well too.  From the opening Pizza Hut commercial (old school fans know what I'm talking about) to the cheezy T.U.R.T.L.E. Power song (where he calls Raphael the leader!) I love this movie so much.  It still gets me riled up, wanting to kick some serious foot clan ass, as they seem to just keep on coming.  The idea of a faceless, numberless enemy, and this loveable, ass-kicking quartet, that makes it so effortless, is so fun to watch.  When you're a child its everything you want to be, four brothers/friends, a great old sensai (Splinter) an intimadating but friends helper (Casey Jones) and of course the babe (April O'Neil), they fight best together, as you see when Raphael cannot defend himself alone on the rooftop, and the one-liners are still as funny as ever: &quot;Whoa, time to switch to decaf April!&quot;  It's true I can quote this entire movie, it's true I watched it every single day when I was a child, but the fact I can still pop it in and enjoy every second, that's a classic flick.  There's also a gritty edge to it, its not just a kids movie, they really stayed in line with the original comic in that sense, its dark and smart, and well made.  I love this movie, I can't wait for a multiple disc Special Edition to come out, I would give anything to just have a few outtakes or bonus scenes, that'd be...AWESOME!",Positive
"Ahh, the memories, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hitting the big screen back in 1990.  I was so excited to go see it.  I thought it was a great movie at the time, and still enjoy watching from time to time.  TMNT stars Judith Hoag as April O'Neal, Elias Koteas as Casey Jones, and Corey Feldmen as the voice of Donatello.The story takes place in New York, where a popular television reporter, April O'Neal, reports of recent rise in crime which she believes there is more to it then what the police department is saying.  Of course, the people doing the crime want her to shut up.  They are The Shredder and his group of ninjas called The Foot.  During an attack by The Foot, April O'Neal is rescued by one of the turtles and taken to the turtles home.  Soon Splinter, the turtles master, is kidnapped and they meet another ally, Casey Jones, who helps to rescue Splinter.Most critics will write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off as a terrible movie.  They always do when it's a movie directed towards the young (with Disney Animated features being the exception).  It may be no Citzen Cane, then again, it isn't trying to be.  More people like it then is willing to admit it, I guarantee that. GRADE: B+",Positive
"This was the best Turtles movie.  Although a little more cartoony then the comic, it's entertaining and violent enough to keep your attention.  Suprisingly it has some good messages about family and brotherhood.",Positive
"I bought this DVD to replace one I'd burned from a TV showing.  It was described accurately and, quite simply, LOVELY.  The thrilling thing, for ME, was that I got to play the games!!!!I taught in TMNT era & LOVED the movie when it first came out.  It reminds me of happy times, before a life-changing car accident.Thank you for selling it to me -J",Positive
"not much i can say about this movie that fans of the movie dont already know!what i can say is this movie needs better dvd treatment and almost every one can agree with me on that,2disk special edition anyone?!",Positive
"I have yet to award a five star review, but the original TMNT movie was pretty damn close.  Any other TMNT movie after the first is for lack of better word, garbage.  The original is on the borderline of classic.  An almost flawless flim with nonstop satisfaction from beginning to end.  The screenplay was executed with supreme excellence, and the settings (both city and country) were perfect.  Most main characters played their parts extremely well.The storyline of the original TMNT movie was inline to the cartoon's original fundamentals.  The individual storyline of the flim was pretty creative and entertaining (Danny turning from thug kid to hug kid).  I've watched this flim a dozen plus times, and it never gets old, at all.  You don't even have to be part of the generation that grew up on the cartoon to fall in love with this flick.  I would strongly recommend this DVD purchase to anyone.  It's a great movie, at a great value (currently around $10 - $15).",Positive
"The movie is a little much for me, but my Grandson loves TMNT.  Perfect gift for a little one that loves these things.",Positive
"Even after all these years, I've still found myself popping this baby in the player a couple of times a year.  An awesome movie that features 4 ninjas who were transformed into turtles when they were little, April, a news reporter, Casey, a human fighter and a rat who raised the turtles.  They all become friends and try to fight off the evil Shredder.  It's an action packed movie with a twist.  It's awesome!",Positive
"I can remeber watching this movie for the first time. My dad surprised us to a sneak peak of it on a Saturday afternoon. We thought we were going to see Ernest Goes to Jail when what I got was one of my favorite movies of all time.The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a huge cartoon show. Anybody that was around in the late 1980's remembers these guys even if they never watched it. The four heros named after the artists have become a pop culture legend and this live action movie of the heros didn't disappoint at all.Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael are the Ninja turtles. They were found by there master Splinter in a sewer in green ooze. The ooze mutated the turtles and splinter into walking talking human size animals. Splinter being from Japan had learned karate from mimicking the moves of his master.April O'neil(Hoag) is one of the top reporters in New York City. Her big report is on a clan of teenage ninjas who call themselves the Footclan. They are running amuck in the city and come after her one night after work. She is saved when the light in the parking lot turns in pitch black. She has no idea who saved her but is grateful.During the fight Raphael loses one of his Sais. Determined to get it back he starts to tag the reporter and follow her. He rescues her again because the Shredder(Saito) has sent his men after her again. He takes her back to the turlte lair and is unaware that he was followed. Splinter nurses April back to health and she befriends the Turtles.Shredder doesn't stop and sends the men for revenge. The Foot kidnap Splinter and the Turtles go into hiding with April. Their cover is soon blown and Foot attacks her at her home. The Turtles along with Casey Jones(Koteas) retreat. With Splinter gone and Raphael hurt the moral is shot of the group. They must recover save Splinter and stop the Footclan.I loved this movie as a child. I have the old school VHS version with the kid in the pizza hut commercial ""Making It Great."" I also love the theme song for the movie ""Turtle Power"" by MC Hammer. Thats some good old school. I use to watch this with my bros and sisters a couple of times a week. We couldn't get enough of it. The movie has a cheesy script but it has so many great one liners that you will never forget. I could probaly quote almost half of the movie to you word for word and get 90% of it pretty accurate.Jim Henson's Muppet Shop did a fantastic job with the Turtles. They didn't look stupid and the fighting scenes with them are terrific. All the costumes are good and Splinter is also real good. Thats the biggest rat I think thats ever been made that wasn't a CGI. It's cool seeing some old school costumes like this instead of CGI.This movie is really easy to get cheap. I found it on DVD for under $5. It doesn't have any extras which really stinks. I hope they decide one day to put this on a special edition DVD.If you want to give your kids a great family movie you wil have no problems with then buy this now. If you liked the cartoon show you have to buy this. Your DVD collection won't be complete without it. It made a $135 milliono back in 1990 which was a ton of money for that time period. That kind of money is still good for now a days. You will have fun with this movie.",Positive
"TMNT really delivers on all fronts, good story, great acting, great directing and amazing action from guys in animatronic rubber suits.This movie is a perfect blend of the dark atmosphere of the original comics and the zany fun of the cartoon series, all the while maintaining a feeling of reality which takes it to the next level.The voice characterizations are right on and the acting from April and Casey Jones gives the validity to the story that it was really in need of.The first confrontation between Casey Jones and Raph in the park is one of the more memorable moments, while the Foot ninja attack on April's apartment is an amazing fight scene even by today's standards.I almost wouldn't consider this a kids movie, even though that's how it's marketed.  It's more along the lines of Spider-Man, than say, Power Rangers.  It got some ""Damn It's"" and the violence it pretty intense at times.Really a great movie and worth your money.",Positive
"This is one of those movies that I think has just been misstreaded when beeing put on DVD. The movie is great, but there are no bonus materials :(Ever since the film came out, we always wondered where that scene was that shows up on the trailer? a scene where the turtles are in the water, and there shells pop up... so with this DVD i was hoping there would be deleted scenes to satasfy that curiosity? But sadly, there isnt even a featurette:(And i know they made featurettes, i remember clearly all those years ago a guy punching in things on a key bourd, and the robotic head of Raphial it was hooked into was moving the facial features around.... so where are those features???For this decent price, its ok. The sewer game is forgetable, might occupy you for a few minutes?! But i'm very disapointed that there is no bonus features with this great ninja comedy.",Positive
"You've got to give Steve Barron credit: any other director might've taken the live-action version of Kevin Eastman's and Peter Laird's creations and produced something more akin to the animated, kid-friendly television show that dominated Saturday morning cartoons for years. Not that this film doesn't have an all-age appeal, but who remembers the original comic book, which was far more gritty and mature than what public television might've allowed? Granted, it's hard to sell the idea of four anthromorphic, ninjutsu-practicing, pizza-loving reptiles to begin with, but once the magic of Jim Henson sets in, a rather simplistic storyline becomes a most refreshing display of kung fu, comedy, and rubber suits that goes beyond expectations.These rubber suits are, of course what sells the movie. Create a costume of a 6-foot turtle that will look good in casual circumstances as well as in stylized combat, and you're close to getting yourself a winner. Master puppetry, coupled with fantastic athletic displays and individual voice-acting cements the four brothers (Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatella) as completely believable characters, immersed in an underground (and, eventually, street-top) battle with a villian - the armoured Shredder - whose spectacle is kept revered throughout the film by an unfaltering darkness to his character, highlighted by real-life crimes of child recruitment. Insert Judith Hoag into her tailor-made role of the reporter, April O'Neil, and wiley Elias Koteas into the character of suave streetfighter Casey Jones, and both of their abilities to react believably to people in costumes, and you've got yourself a winner.Well, maybe not yet. Though one can't expect much out of an action film when it comes to storylines, ""Turtles"" pulls it off by filling the fast-paced, quick-evented timeline with enough personality to make up for the relative speedy plot, which includes abduction, ambush, capture, retreat, reconciliation, emotional unearthing, return, battle-battle, and victory - all within 90 minutes. While I would have enjoyed certain aspects of the story (mainly, the time of the story spent between scenes) to be elaborated on more than they were, you can only praise the film for managing to plausibly tell the entire storyline of the original comic in the time that it did, by giving necessary focus on the multi-dimensional proportions of key scenes (ex: the reprieve at the farm, the Shredder's corraling of his recruits). In conclusion, the film pulls off the storytelling as well as and maybe even better than most other action films, securely a good mark in the field, but keeping it from being perfect (maybe if the film had been 30 minutes longer...).By keeping everything in context with the original publication, and by throwing in just the right amount of quirky humor, the film achieves most of its potential. A $13 million budget and collaboration with Jim Henson pay off by producing a cult film which sequels have yet to top (as well as a worldwide profit of about $200 million), and which cinematic history has yet to render obsolete.For fans of the franchise, this film is an absolute must-buy. Casuals viewers who find nothing wrong with talking, butt-kicking turtles and nifty kung-fu should likewise find no fault in this film. It's one of the few features that makes up for its shortcomings (the few that there are) with sheer fun and enjoyment. You'd have to be remarkably prim to not give this happy little masterpiece a watch.",Positive
"I honestly feel sorry for this generation of kids, cause they all turn up their noses at the really good kid's movies like this. Sure, so the idea of mutated pizza-loving reptiles who also have martial arts abilities seems stupid, but I'd say the plot has a lot more potential than all the fluff out there that is all parents consider appropriate anymore.  I can't really describe what it is about this movie. It just has a certain mood that they don't quite capture in any of the sequels. And it actually does have drama in it, though you wouldn't THINK that a bunch of turtles and a rat could make you cry. One thing I love about this movie is that all of the turles have their own personality; in the sequels and the more recent cartoon version they all act exactly alike, and are all, well, STUPID.Probably my favorite scene is the long fight in April O' Neill's apartment; from the point where the enemies bust in through the ceiling to where the fire starts and then they all go to...well, maybe I shouldn't spoil anything. Just go out and rent this, watch it with the kids, see if they prefer it over their little Power Rangers and Dragonball Z.",Positive
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were the cartoon craze I remember growing up.  I was so happy someone finally put the movie on DVD.  While this movie wasn't great as far as technical standards it still did a great job capturing the story line and personalities.  I thought maybe I had outgrown the turtles but as soon as I saw the movie again I was hooked.  I couldn't wait to find an original Nintendo and start playing the TMNT game again.  You've got to own this part of independent film history.,Positive
"Yes, this movie is a classic. I feel very lucky to have grown up when the Ninja Turtles first became popular. This was back at a time when thought and care went into children's entertainment. Unlike the stuff kids are watching today. All of the characters in the Ninja Turtles series have distinct personalities and they're all lovable in their own way. If you loved this movie when you were a kid you'll still love it as an adult. Sure, the movie looks dated but it is far superior to the recent kids movies out there like &quot;Power Rangers.&quot;",Positive
wonderful movie to share with the kids and the turtles seem so real- maybe they are,Positive
"I have always been a fan of the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" cartoons at a very young age. I have a lot of the episodes on tape and love to still watch them. I had heard that there were three non-animation movies out on the series but was never really compelled to see them. But the other day while at the video rental store, I decided to rent all three out. And what a surprise I got when I saw the first film for I actually enjoyed and loved watching it!15 years have passed since a rat named Splinter (Kevin Clash) found four baby turtles in a puddle of ooze in the sewers. Because of the contact with the ooze, Splinter and the four turtles became mutants. Naming them after Renaissance artists, Leonardo (David Forman), Raphael (Josh Pais), Michaelangelo (Michelan Sisti), and Donatello (Leif Tilden), Splinter teaches them the ancient secret art of fighting. When the mysterious evil Shredder James Saito organizes the Foot Clan formed of young teenagers, causing the city to be in uproar because of vandalism. With the help of reporter April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and former athlete Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to save the day!The movie has an interesting story-line if not extremely cheesy and corny but hey, that's how the original cartoons were! In fact, I would have found the movie unlikable if it hadn't contained some of the cartoon aspects of the original series. Also a lot of interesting facts are revealed like how Splinter's past is related to Shredder and the beginnings of the turtles.Comparing the movie to the series, I was a bit surprised to find that movie usually centers on the character of Raphael. His character is a bit different from the series, a bit more hot-tempered, impatient, and more of a loner. Leonardo is still the leader, Donatello doesn't get much chance to work with gadgets and computers, and Michaelangelo... well... he's still his usual likable self! April O'Neal is also working for Channel 3 news instead of Channel 6 News. The adding of Elias Koteas as Casey Jones was an interesting thread to insert for he was a fun and likable guy.The martial arts and fighting were well choreographed and was enjoyable to watch. I especially liked the fight at April's place, the end fight with the Foot, and the last fight with Shredder. The movie is also sprinkled from beginning to end with funny parts, quotable lines, and humor. Jim Henson should also get credit for doing an incredible job with the turtles and Splinter.To sum of the movie, whether you are or aren't a turtles fan, I highly recommend this movie! Lots of fun and great entertainment, it's terrific for the family. The movie is rated PG because of some language, the fighting, and since it has some dark moments. I also recommend the next two ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" movies. The second one, ""The Secret of the Ooze"" is my personal favorite of the three.",Positive
"Cowabunga? Lame to many now, but then it was great before Power rangers infested the TV and then Pokemon controlling our kids into some Poke-cult.  Well this movie was the last of the rough PG movies.  That was before the  parent groups got in the way with how extreme things get.  This movie came  out in a beautiful time when PG movies were worth something.  This movie  has well choreographed martial arts sequences, pretty funny as the young  ninjas characters are, and it had issues.  The type of issues that kids and  parents share from generation to generation, unfortunately at the time  parent groups focused their attention more on the violence. I am not saying  that they are wrong.  It is a rough violent movie, but I did not see heavy  ""actual"" fighting, any blood.  Blood as in oozing liquid.  There was a  death though (not truly as the next movie proved), and a couple in a memory  so I understand that part, but in Bambi they shot Bambi's mother.  Anyway,  this movie has no ""don't do this kid, cause it is bad for you"" or ""you evil  villain, you will never get away with this.""  This is not like that at  all.Ninja Turtles used their trained skills and street smarts to survive  and thrive, instead of using machines and alien given powers, or pokedecks.  The four turtles were raised and trained by their master, who is more like  a father to them, Splinter.  Past meets present, where a ninja clan that  used to terrorize Japan `back in the day' has returned to the streets of  New York.  The turtles do not go out stopping this ninja clan, the clan  goes after them first.  The ninja clan strikes hard and does lost of  physical and emotional damage to the mutant family and then, things get  personal.This movie is good the way it is, but if it was revised in a  PG-13 way, a little darker, serious fight scenes mixed with Jackie Chan  like fight scenes, some up beat music, then we would have a neat movie for  sure.  This movie is good as it is.  No cheep computer Jar-Jar Binks  animation too, machines and puppeteering always looked more convincing.",Positive
"Well, it was a fun movie to laugh at, I'll tell you what. Ha ha ha, those funny rubber masks.",Positive
"I have always loved this movie.It was everything that the other Ninja Turtle movies were not.It was dark,and was a bit serious,but at the same time,there was humor in it.Both kids and adults could enjoy this movie.Although there is a few violent scenes(such as Shredder's death) that some parents might not want their kids watching...but that's up to the parents.Overall though,this is a really good enjoyable film.I thought the other Turtle movies were complete crap.I wish they would come out with a two disc special edition of this,with deleted scenes,commentary,and other cool stuff,because this is one of the greatest comic book movies of all time.Right up there with Tim Burton's Batman and The original Superman movie in my opinion.",Positive
"This is the original TMNT movie that was released to theaters in 1990 to cash-in on the first wave of Turtle-mania. What surprises most fans about this movie today is that it still holds up reasonably well, and is a strong comic book movie in its own right. Instead of being based off the campy original cartoon, the movie is based off the darker, grittier comic books. Interestingly, the new 2003 animated series also took a cue from the comics, and there are similiar story elements in both the movie and the first season of the show (origin story, fight in antique shop, retreat to the farm, etc.) It's almost as if the writers anticipated the second coming of the Turtles and made a movie to last two different followings.The DVD is bare bones, but at least it's reasonably cheap. It's a decent addition to your collection if you're a Turtles' fan or if you know someone who's just getting into the new series (though beware: some scenes are surprisingly violent for kids).Oh, and the sequels are worth a rental just for nostalogic value and to see how badly things went downhill after this movie.",Positive
"I have the original videotape, LaserDisc, and MovieCD of this movie. (MovieCD - not VideoCD. MovieCDs are CD-ROMs of movies that can be played on your computer. They used to be sold at computer stores.) Yes, I like this movie. Someday I will probably get the DVD. I do have a few of the toys.Most of my comics are in storage so forgive me for a few minor errors on issue numbers and such. I started reading the original Mirage comics around #16 when the guest artists were just starting to become active. I think I stuck with it to the end. I have the colorized volumes that contained #1-12. (The original comics were black & white.) I also have a few issues of the newer, somewhat weird Ninja Turtles published by Image. I never read any of the Archie issues. I also watched the TV series during the first season.This movie is largely an adaptation of plot elements from an actual story in the original comics - with the order of events flipped around a bit. The fight with Shedder on the rooftop was actually from the first issue (or story if I'm wrong about the issue #) Other plot elements come from around #8-12. The Shedder was not the primary villian in the Mirage comics. He only appeared in a few issues.In the original comics, April was the lab assistant for an evil scientist named Baxter Stockman. She wasn't a news reporter. The Turtles actually met her while rescuing her from Stockman's inventions. In this movie, they met her in a totally different way. For the kids, April is a news reporter.Except for a couple of issues by guest artists, the original Turtles never ate pizza.Overall, this movie is loyal to the essence of the original Ninja Turtle comics with some elements from the children's version mixed in. This is the only movie in the series to do that. It is also the darkest of the movies. The others are strictly for the kids. However, I do enjoy some elements of the third movie, but it's still more of a children's movie. I hate the second one.I think this was the next to last movie Jim Henson did work on. He's not listed in some references, but he is on the TMNT's official web site - where there is a photo of him with his creation. There are also signs that a new movie might be in the works.",Positive
who doesnt remember ninja turtles its timeless my sons watched as a kid and which one where you when you watched now the grandchildren are watching it still works 20 years later,Positive
"If you want to see men dressed in costomes with fake rubber muscels, then get this movie. It's the original and still the best. The subway fight sceen in this movie is 100 times better than the subway fight sceen in the 2004 movie Hellboy.",Positive

"They eat pizza,they practice Ninja and they're reptiles. Michaelanglo,Donatelo,Leonardo and Raphael are now the movie. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: the Movie. America's Favorite green teens are brought to life by Jim Henson's creature shop. From the comic book and the popular tv show comes the movie adaptation about four turtles who from a ooze substance evolved in walking talking human like reptiles, given renisance artist names by their master who discovered when they were normal turtles, Splinter,a rat who envolved in size and speaking too. They live in a New York sewer den and they meet and befriend Newsreporter April O'Neal. When an Ninja organization called the Foot lead by the turtle's archenemy The Shredder, finds out about the turtles and kidnapps Splinter,The fighting foursome and their new friend Casey Jones, a former hockey player, must battle the Foot,save splinter and defeat the Shredder. One of the best movies of the 90s and a great movie to start off the 1990s,high kicking fun,action packed,funny,terrific entertainment.One Shell of a time,The Turtles still rule,these boys truly are radical reptiles. If you enjoyed the tv show as a kid like I did, see their blockbuster movie, if you haven't or If you saw the Movie, then see the Sequel, The Secret of the Ooze. The third one not so good, I don't recommend it. I strongly recommend this awsome movie. Bring home the green teens and anyone who tells you the turtles suck give SHELL! They're one of most famous movie fighting foursomes among others like Ghostbusters. This is one of best 90s films known to Man or turtle. COWABUNGA!",Positive
This reminded me of my childhood.  Very funny and cool movie from a comic book.  This was a great buy.,Positive
"Like many kids who were around in the late 80's/early 90's, I LOVE The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I watched the saturday morning cartoon that aired on CBS, my brother and I played the TMNT video games on NES  (Remember the very first one? I could play it 'til my thumbs bleed!) and Super Nintendo, my brother and I collected the TMNT action figures, and watched our VHS copies of the first two TMNT films so many times, that they wore out.ANYWAY, the film's plot: One day, four turtles named Leonardo, Donnatello, Michaelangelo, and Raphael, and their soon-to-be mentor, a rat named Splinter come in contact with ""the ooze"", and they are mutated into humanoids who can walk upright and talk! Splinter becomes their mentor and guardian, and teaches them all he knows about the Ninjitsu fighting style. The turtles decide to fight crime in New York City with their new skills. Soon Splinter is kidnapped by his former master and arch nemesis, an evil man who wants to control the world, known as Shredder, so it's up to the turtles to defeat him and rescue Splinter!This film definitely holds up well today, considering that it's a late 80's film. If you were a fan of TMNT during the late 80's/early 90's, check this out if you haven't already! Oh, and do yourself a favor by checking out TMNT II: Secret of the Ooze, which is an excellent sequel, and AVOIDING the third TMNT film, which is atrocious.",Positive
I just love this dvd!! I have watched it several times.I have also tried to find others like it. It is addictive!!,Positive
"What astounds me about these dance/percussion numbers is their intricacy, which must have required relentless rehearsing, and yet there is almost an improvisational, immediate quality about them; some of them are performed on a stage, some on location in New York City, and they seamlessly segue from one to another. I especially like the transition from the alley ball game into the kitchen with the marvelous cigar-chomping chef.This innovative show was created in the early 90s in the U.K. by Luke Cresswell and Steve McNicholas (who met in 1981 as members of a street band called &quot;Pookiesnackenburger&quot;) and they share directorial credits for this HBO film; the show in its stage version has received numerous awards with its many productions around the globe.Some of these performers have star quality, and it's a shame names are not put to the faces, but with so many different casts world-wide, even the ones in this film remain only as part of a list in alphabetical order. The cinematography is also excellent, by Christophe Lanzenberg.One would think that a wordless show with only percussion for music would become monotonous, but it captures and holds our attention because of its imaginitive skill, its humor, and the talent and energy of its performers. Dance fans will love &quot;Stomp Out Loud&quot;. Total running time is 50 minutes, and that includes a 5 minute sketch on the who, how, and where of the film.",Positive
"What else can I say?  This is the DVD to get if you still haven't got a chance to see this type of performance live.  If you can see it live, do it.  Sell your house if you have to.",Positive
"This DVD is fantastic.  I am a public school Music/Dance instructor.  I use it as a resource after I have taught poly-rhythms and syncopation.  Also, it is simply a great performance.",Positive
"We already know the extent to which complex, entertaining rythmic compositions can flow from this ensemble's use of everyday ordinary objects, household items, or even junk.  Stomp is so clever that way, and I can't help but reminisce about how often I banged on stuff just for entertainment in my younger days.This performance, taken from an HBO special in 1997, sacrifices a bit of the energy of Stomp's live show for the more intimate perspective gained by having a camera filming in the midst of the performers.  More interesting still are the different locales (all in New York City) used for a number of the routines:  a Soho alley, a kitchen, a rooftop, and even under a pier at a sugar refinery.  I thought the camera work was excellent, and I appreciated having different ""stages"" upon which to showcase these talented performers (they're all accomplished percussionists).  The on-stage (i.e., with the audience) portion of the show differs from the rest in that four cameras were employed to capture a variety of viewing angles from on-stage and off.  You can't get this experience from seeing them live (for me, twice), so that's why I like having this DVD.  Aside from the percussive interaction of the ""band,"" you can also see their faces, so there's an acting component of the show that adds another fun dimension.A few minor disappointments:  fifteen chapters (performance routines) are listed in the keep case notes; however, there's no #15 in the show.  Also, the run time was several minutes shy of the stated 50 minutes (the missing routine?) which is REAL short to begin with.  The ""Special Features"" part of the disc contains nothing but reading material and a few photos.  I was hoping for something like ""Stomp - Behind the Scenes,"" which would have been a blast, so there's almost nothing to be experienced in terms of the group members' personalities or the filming experience.  Maybe on another DVD . . .Overall, I'd recommend this to just about anyone interested in percussion or performance art.",Positive
"Weighing this video against the live production would have yielded only three stars.  However, because the video is excellent, certainly better than anything like it, it gets four from me.  The only outside scenes that  are as good as the tidbits from the live show are the basketball routine  and the rythym board dance.  If you like the tape, see them live.",Positive
We saw the stage production years ago and appreciated the talent then. The DVD is as good and more. No one leaves the room when this is playing.,Positive
"of course nothing compares to actually being in the theatre watching the actual show, but that only lasts for a little over an hour. when you want to see the amazing talent of these musicians, this dvd shows it.i highly recommend this dvd. it is absolutley amazing, the skills. you'll really get wrapped up in the catchy rythyms and beats.",Positive
"I've seen ""Stomp"" in New York City eight times -- and strongly suspect more to come.  Meanwhile, how wonderful to own Stop Out Loud which I remember having seen on TV and loving it as much as the live show.  My only negative is that the creators of Stomp should (to quote Stephen Sondheim) GIVE US MORE TO SEE!",Positive
Stomp Out Loud is incredible! The multi-media presentation gets its point across with hardly any dialog. The performers are excellent and the routines are unique and fun to watch as well as listen! I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to see something different.,Positive
"Incredible.  If you have never seen Stomp live, then do it!  If that is impossible, then watch this video.  These masters of rhythm are awesome.  Whether they have a basketball, a broom, or a butcher knife in their hands, they create drama, energy and excitement through rhythm!  There are segments in this video that could not be performed live.  That is a bonus!  Also, the short documentary about &quot;Stomp&quot; is incredible!  My children love this as well.  Great for the whole family!",Positive
Bought this for my Great granddaughter. She enjoys it and watches it all the time over and over. My kids loved  it also,Positive
I set out to collect the full set of Land Before Time movies and this adds another to the set.  I really like the characters and story line of these movies.,Positive
"worth the price paid, but i must say that it is not up to the standards set by vol one of the set.",Positive
Our Children & Grandchildren Loved this Land Before Time Movie. they are so cute to watch & so colorful & has all kinds of different Dinosaurs in them. Plus ithey teach them to share & help others.,Positive
"We love this series.  My son has been watching it since he was very little and of course I was right there watching it with him.  The shows have great messages and were a great teaching tool with their homilies.  Little Bear is another series that is fun to watch with wonderful teaching moments, too.",Positive
"Verdi - La Traviata / Levine, Stratas, DomingoI saw this production in 1986 and I was so impressed with this performance that I always want to have this particular version of la Traviata. I saw this DVD when I received this one a couple of weeks ago and my opinion didn't change.",Positive
"""La Traviata"" is undoubtedly Verdi's loveliest and most romantic opera, with no subplots to detract from the ill-fated love of Violetta and Alfredo, and the melodies are sublime and plentiful.Though as a rule I prefer a stage production to an ""opera film"", because the vocals usually have less passion to them, and the lip-synching is often noticeable, ""La Traviata"" is ideally suited to director Zeffirelli's lavish style of sumptuous ornate sets and beautiful outdoor settings, making this an opera that would be enjoyed by those who are either unfamiliar with, or don't particularly like opera, as well as the aficionados.Teresa Stratas is a delicate, wonderful Violetta, with her huge eyes and petite stature assets for the part of the ailing heroine, and Placido Domingo, with beard and tousled hair, is fabulous as Alfredo, a part that is surely one of the most nave and foolish of heroes, but blessed with marvelous music to sing.James Levine conducts with good pacing, and Cornell MacNeil makes an excellent Papa Germont.A special treat for ballet fans is the performance by the exquisite Russian ballerina Ekaterina Maximova, and her husband, the great Vladimir Vasiliev, as the Spanish matador dancers; The choreography is by Alberto Testa, and includes Gabriella Borni as the gypsy dancer. This Second Act scene, with the ""Noi siamo zingarelle"" and ""Di Madride noi siam mattadori"" is some of the most delightful music in the opera, and it is marvelous to see it danced so well.The DVD extras are supposed to be: Production notes, Cast/filmmakers' bios, Film highlights, Theatrical trailer, and web links, but my disc did not display options, so was obviously defective; I would have loved to have removed the captions and subtitles, which is also an option, as well as being able to have subtitles in French.A sublime opera with a terrific cast, this is very satisfying viewing and listening, even for ""stage production"" fanatics like me. Total playing time is 1 hour and 45 minutes.",Positive
"Parece que la extraviada (Traviata)realmente esta muy enferma al final ya que la escena esta incompleta. esto no deberia asombrarnos ya que Zeffirelli hizo algo peor con su Otello con su recortada aria del Sauce. Excepto este detalle no tan importante como el Otello, la pelicula es muy bella aunque para los puristas, entre los que me incluyo humildemente quizas por mi condicion de Profesor de Apreciacion Musical, encuentro en ella tal como note en la Carmen de Migenes y Domingo, ruidos innecesarios que en la presentacion en un teatro serian imperdonables; al fin y al cabo lo importante es la musica y no los extras caprichosos de Zeffirelli. A pesar de estos pequenos detalles la presentacion es maravillosa; las cuatro estrelas en vez de cinco obedecen a estas para algunos quizas necedades. Para mi repito, soy un purista y pienso en la intencion siempre del compositor. Recomiendo la version de Beverly Sills y ni se diga la de Angela Ghiorgiu, superiores excepto los tenores ya que Placido Domingo sigue siendo el mejor.",Positive
"This is now a classic.  You will be amazed by the exquisite setting.  Well, the acting is not exactly what you expect from a movie, but you have to remember that this is an opera not a movie.  The singers are expected to  hit the right note at the right time, so the acting is not their priority.  But having said that, it is far better than any the usual opera singer  acting!  The singing is excellent, but I would not say the best.  Just  remember that there are better recordings of this opera in the market.  But  none of them comes with this kind of visual spectacles.  In that sense, the  slight imperfection in the singing is more than fully compensated.  Domingo  looks a bit too old for his role in the picture, but even today he still  sings this role (in reality he is old enough to play the father of  Alfredo!)  You must see this.",Positive
"Only the film version of Carmen tops this breathtakingly beautiful and sumptuous production of La Traviata. During the overture we see Violetta towards the end of the opera, nearing her tragic death. She looks more like a phantasm, especially when seen next to her lovely portrait, painted when she was radiating beauty and health. Act one thus marks the start of Violetta reminiscing about how she and Alfredo fell in love. This is a most effective beginning, and as this is a film it gives us unique new insights into one of Verdi's most well-known and beloved operas. As such, it allows us to view the opera with new eyes, making us fall in love with it all over again. The singing and acting of Domingo and Stratas are outstanding, although that of Cornell Macneil is somewhat stiff. Aside from perhaps tradionalists who believe that opera can only be performed in the opera house, this film version is sure to please opera and non-opera fans alike.",Positive
"I'm not well versed in opera and am not a pro, but I have always loved the sound of operatic voices and the beautiful orchestrations behind them. &quot;La Traviata&quot; is, in my own opinion, beautifully done. This movie has gorgeous scenery. The voices and music were pre recorded and the actors lipsinc, which is often done in musical movies like &quot;Cats&quot; and &quot;Grease,&quot; so that is not unusual. The performances, in my opinion, are wonderful, and the orchestrations perfect. The scenery, as I said, is very beautiful, with scenes in Paris and in a forest and in a garden. There is plenty of eye candy here! Teresa Statas has a wonderful and powerful voice. Her performance, to me, is flawless, but as I said I am no expert in opera- some other reviewers were not impressed. Placido Domingo is of course wonderful, and so is Cornell Macneil. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone, even if you don't like opera, because it is breathtaking! I was disappointed by the bonus materials because I always like to see interviews with the producers and actors, but these materials seem to be rare on DVDs for some reason. There are production notes, which you read on the screen, cast abd fuknnajers; bios, which you read on the screen, film highlights (I have not yet looked at this), Theatrical Trailer, and web links. Wonderful movie!",Positive
"This is a movie, not a stage production. The music is superb, and the scenery is excellent. It is traditional costuming. I had the same version on tape, but wanted a DVD version; as it is so terrific. I gave the tape to a friend, who likes this rendition as much as I do. Some criticize the lack of certain scenes, but in my opinion, the overall merit of this performance more then makes up for that.",Positive
"This could have been the ideal version to have on DVD.The opera is presented in a grand and lavish d&eacute;cor that will be hard to reproduce on a stage performance. Act 1 in Violetta's house in Paris is if anything too rich, but splendid too watch.  Her getting drunk and violent at the end is rather pointless. At the beginning of act 2, Zeffirelli repeats the music of the opening of act 1, to show Violetta's departure for the countryside. Totally unnecessary, as Verdi never wrote anything of the kind. The gardens and the country-house in act 2 are wonderful, so is the photography. In act 2 scene 2, we are back in Paris in a very similar house to act 1, too similar in a way. The party is good, the dancers are good and the staging of the drama, excellent. In act 3, Zeffiirelli cuts away all the music before Violetta's big are ""Addio del passato"" gaining 5 minutes and loosing the point of her being generous, even on her death-bed by giving all her money to the poor. At the end, Violetta seems to run around too much for a woman about to die from consumption. Now for the singers. Teresa Stratas has an ideal face and figure for the role and her acting is excellent. She copes vocally with most things but really goes to pieces in ""Sempre libera"" screaming instead of singing at the end.  Domingo is wonderful throughout, both vocally and visually. Macneil is adequate in every way, but not exceptional. James Levine, in my opinion is a bad conductor when it comes to Verdi, and this score shows his weaknesses. The music simply does not flow as it should, and the climaxes are poor. I do not know who is better on DVD but on CD try Giulini, Serafin, Kleiber, Toscanini, or even Muti to see what I mean.If you want  a spectacular Traviata on DVD, I feel this is the one to get.  It could have easily been so much better, but this is true of most things. My advice, get it quick because it seems to be disappearing from the catalogues.",Positive
"Franco Zeffirelli wanted to bring opera to the screen so that more people could enjoy it.  I'm sure he succeeded with this production of Verdi's La Traviata with such divine music.It's also interesting to note how often Wagner and Verdi invoke Almighty God in their operas since this was the post period of enlightenment, and here we deal with redemption of sins.A powerful performance.  The only minor problem was the filtering as in Act 1 giving the screen an orange-red hue.",Positive
"This is so excellent and holds up so well over time.  I've had the LD for many years; the DVD is superior.  Hopefully this release is a precursor for the release of other Zeffirelli material:  Otello (also Domingo), Taming of  the Shrew, Romeo and Juliet, and the Met material that has been offered in  the past by DGG (including Turandot).Zeffirelli is a unique and gifted  director of classic material.  Bravo, Franco...!!",Positive
"I think opera, as a tradition, tends to stagnate in, well...tradition. It's good that opera is also being expanded to the media of today. This for-film movie production takes all advantage that the video medium has to grant, without the limitations of a traditional filmed stage production. The acting is perfect (Domingo gets better every time I see him, and this performance tops the cake). The casting is very appropriate (Stratas is indeed the sickly prima donna!). Also, the cinematography and camera-work are the work one might expect from Hollywood, not from opera: superb!All in all, buy it for its creativity.",Positive
"I loved this film.  Only about 20 minutes were excised from the score, it was nearly complete.  At greater length in the other reviews can be read descriptions of the ballet, breathtakingly beautiful scenery, particularly effective arias.  Domingo and Stratas were wonderful.  I have Stratas in Boheme on DVD (to replace my original VHS), it made me cry.  Traviata made me cry.  Can you call anything so painful beautiful?  The music was of course glorious.  The principals acted and sang to perfection, and of course frail diminutive Stratas looked the part.  The movie began interesting, then became wonderful at the first party with the drinking song, then lost interest for me for some time, then picked up again and never let up.  The camera-work and crowd scenes were brilliantly done.  (I don't like to use the word &quot;brilliant&quot; because it sounds so affected, but I will.)  I resent the reviews that call this a good introduction to opera, as though it were somehow inferior to &quot;real opera,&quot; I find it condescending, supercilious, pompous and demeaning.  However, I gave a copy of the movie to a close friend of mine who also cried, watched it twice and loved it, and this was I think her first opera.  It is very beautiful music, well-acted, well-directed, well-sung and with scenery beyond belief.",Positive
"Franco Zeffirelli has repeatedly proved his affinity for opera on the stage of the Metropolitan.  The tableau at the end of the opening scene of &quot;Tosca&quot; and the split level second act of &quot;La Boheme&quot; with the street scene above and the restaurant below come to mind.  In this 1982 film he takes Verdi's tragic opera and trims it down to a brisk 105 minutes that retains all of the emotional highlights.  Zeffirelli proves his mastery before the first note of music is even played.  The overture to Verdi's opera is quite atypical.  At the time operas began with a loud rush of music, but in &quot;La Traviata&quot; Verdi saves that for the first act.  Verdi's overture begins with the strings playing as softly as possible, seducing the restless audience into quiet and communicating quite clearly that what they are about to see is a tragedy.  The first part of the overture is Violetta's death motif, which reappears again before the final scene.  The second half repeats a theme several times with the hope that the audience will remember it when it shows up as one of the shortest arias in opera when Violetta leaves Alfredo.  Zeffirelli does two things to enhance this overture.  First, he does all of the opening credits, done over shots of the Paris locale, before the music starts.  Second, Zeffirelli sets the scene of the overture right BEFORE the final scene.  Violetta's apartment is dark and shadowy figures move about, removing items.  A young man is removing a lamp and just as the second part of the overture begins he looks up--and there is a portrait of Violetta.  Entranced by her beauty he sees the doctor leaving and heads down the hallway and tentatively opens the door to Violetta bedroom.  But what he sees is a woman dying from consumption.  The director continues this conceit, having Violetta startled by the rushing music of the first Act and suddenly seeing light and party guests down the hall.On stage the appearance of the characters in an opera is of minimal importance.  If Joan Sutherland and Luciano Pavarotti are pretending to be youngsters in love we go along with the game because of the pure joy of listening to their voices.  Certainly Zeffirelli pays some attention to how his singers look in this film.  Teresa Stratas is a relatively delicate soprano, whose physical frailty is well exploited in the final scenes.  Placido Domingo is a robust Alfredo and while the pair are obviously older than their characters, we could not seriously expect Zeffirelli to do what he did in his classic &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; and find young singers to carry the film.  Cornell MacNeil is also in fine voice as Giorgio Germont, Alfredo's father who successfully beseeches Violetta to give my Alfredo so as not to ruin the marital prospects of his daughter.  The cinematography is consistent with the director's best films and my only real complaint is that the subtitles do not cover all of the male chorus' big number about the matador, which offers a rather ironic counterpart to what is about to happen at that point in the story.  For years I have been showing this film to students who had never seen an opera and their almost universal opinion is that it was actually more enjoyable than they expected.  Imagine your response if you are actually incline to like opera.",Positive
"This video which is a movie, sung and performed by wellknown opera singers taken at luxurious homes and country side scenery as background is really a marvellous combination of the usual opera performance and natural movie shooting.Placido Domingo as the young and romantic Alfredo sung so perfectly, so that he enlivened the tragic story of the young man falling in love to the wayward lady, Violetta. While Teresa Stratas, with her clear full voice, matching Domingo in her superb singing and performance, emphasized the tragic nuance of the music itself. Also Cornell MacNeil as Alfredo's father, Giorgio sung as beautifully as the others in his deep bass baritone voice and made the whole performance more than perfect.We are especially moved by the magnificent romantic duets of Alfredo and Violetta and also the tragic duets of Violetta and Alfredo's father, Giorgio. Meanwhile we also adore the beautiful scenery in the luxurious rooms and country side, which cannot be viewed if perform on stage.In overall this video is totally so enchanting with magnificent music and singing with excellent and beautiful background scenery from beginning to the end.",Positive
"When this film was first released in New York, I went to see it, and by the end, I couldn't leave the theater because it left me an absolute mess.  I was such a mess that when I finally did venture out into daylight, I had no sense of where I was or where I was going. I stopped in at a local diner for lunch, and as I was leaving, the girl behind the register sympathetically said, ""Have a good day."" The way she said it finally made me laugh and snap out of it.  I later went to see the film four more times.No film, operatic or otherwise, has ever moved me quite like this one.  Only after distancing myself from it a while can I take another look at it.  There are definite flaws: the cuts, the notorious engineering that makes the score play a half-tone flat thoughout (maybe that's why Stratas doesn't always sound her best), the entire production is way overdressed...  But still, this is one of the best opera films ever made, with many touching moments in the more intimate scenes, and Stratas wrings the pathos out of it for all its worth.  It deserves a special place in the collection.",Positive
"As a film, not a stage production, this is the best available, if not without flaws.  The Covent Garden live stage performance with Solti is terrific as well.  Stratas' acting good as always but her pitch and tone quality often off the mark which I'm surprised wasn't fixed.  Domingo is wonderful(I don't care about age; the performance is most important)and the cast singing is fine.  Certainly far superior to the recent Paris broadcast with Cura!  Moffo's Traviata is good but dubbing a film is always tacky and you just seem to have to make allowances for it.  Looking good takes priority over singing; people who don't understand the dynamics of singing opera (not always attractive) prefer to have the singer's mouths &quot;look pretty/handsome&quot; - that's why I prefer videos of stage productions rather than opera movies.  I just make allowances for the difference and don't let it get in the way of enjoying one of my favorite operas.  I recommend this along with the Covent Garden and Beverly Sills' videos.  It still weaves some wonderful magic!",Positive
"I just saw this for the first time a few days ago and I was awestruck.  &quot;La Traviata&quot; is my favorite opera, and to see Placido play the lead was so incredible.  Franco Zeffirelli did a fantastic job with this  opera-movie.  Visually, it is heaven for the eyes.  As for the acting, it  is a bit rough around the edges, but the beauty of the music makes up for  it.  Teresa Stratas' portrayal of Violetta is not the best I have heard.  Placido was amazing as usual.  The rest of the cast is good and the scene  with the gypsies and bullfighters was absolutely stunning.  This is a  must-see for opera fans and even people who don't care for opera would  enjoy it.",Positive
"The subtitled VHS version of this film was a great introduction for me years ago when I was learning about opera. Despite the valid criticisms about some of Zeffirelli's cuts and embellishments, I still think it's a beautiful film, both visually and musically. It's great to have it finally available on DVD, in widescreen format.I do have a major criticism of the DVD however. Although there are regular subtitles in French, the English titles are actually &quot;Captions for the hearing impaired.&quot; This is the only option for English titles, so there are sometimes distracting descriptive captions on screen: eg. &quot;[Music Starts]....[Laughing]....[People Singing]....[Finale}&quot; One would think that Universal, an American company, would have provided standard English subtitles as well. (There were standard subtitles on the VHS version and, I would assume, on the American theatrical release.)The nice thing about subtitles on opera DVDs is that they can be used when one is learning about a new opera, but then turned off when they become intrusive. The English captions are adequate for this purpose and I would still highly recommend this disc for newcomers and opera fans alike.",Positive
"This film looks beautiful and the performances by Domingo and Stratas are wonderful (although she is not in her best voice). James Levine's conducting and the playing of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra are as good as you can hear anywhere. The ballet is spectacular. But Zeffirelli cuts away at least one-fourth of the score. He (and many other film makers who have made movies of operas) just doesn't seem to understand that a film of an opera is not an adaptation; it is a performance of that opera using a different medium. An opera is a musical composition; therefore, a film of an opera is a musical performance of a music drama. The film medium frees the visual presentation from the limitations of the stage, but the musical presentation is the essence of the opera and must not be compromised regardless of the medium. Some of Zeffirelli's cuts must infuriate any lover of opera. For example, when Giorgio departs from Violetta after she has promised to leave Alfredo, Zeffirelli cuts some of the &quot;addio&quot;s, saving just a few seconds but destroying the end of the scene. If the opera is more important to you than the cinematography, you may want to buy the DVD starring Angela Gheorghiu and Frank Lopardo, conducted by the late Georg Solti.",Positive
"This is without a doubt the greatest version of La Traviata ever produced.On DVD, it's unbelievably gorgeous and features production notes and cast bios as well as a trailer. The forces behind this masterpiece are responsible for its greatness- Italian director and designer Franco Zefferelli, tenor Placido Domingo, soprano Teresa Stratas and baritone Cornell McNeil. The singers are at the top of their game, Domingo is a young, sexy Alfredo and Teresa Stratas IS Violetta Valery in a performance that even Maria Callas would envy. Zefferelli had Maria Callas in mind when he cast Teresa Stratas. Like Callas, Stratas has a Greek background through her parents though she was Canadian born, she has the same type of voice and she is in Zefferelli's own words ""an electrifying actress and soprano of the lyric entertainment"". The Callas connection is most obvious when Stratas appears in a black veiled gown in Act 2 at Flora's party where even her hair is similar to Callas' infamous 50's performances.Released in 1982, Zefferelli sought to ""convert"" people into opera lovers through the lush visual seduction of the cinema. This is exactly what he did. The cinematography of this film kills you with excessive beauty. The opening credits roll as we see scenes of Paris in the Notre Dame Cathedral area and surrounding residential district by the Seine river. The interior of Violetta Valery's mansion, where she hosts the Act 1 party, is luxurious and Zefferelli allows us to be dizzied with the sheer opulence of the house- gilded mirrors, portraits of Violetta, curtains, chandeliers etc. Visually on film we are able to tell things about the characters that stage performances do not, for example as the guests depart from Act 1's party, an old woman steals a silver box from Violetta proving to us that Violetta is not among real friends, these are only fair-weathered friends and bad ones at that. They were not even there for her when she was dying in the finale.The beginning of the film has Violetta reminiscing about the better days as a desirable and wealthy courtesan who partied all the time. She is deathly ill and already her house is sold and men are moving her things out. The country scenes are incredibly beautiful as Violetta and Alfredo live happily in seclusion. Alfredo rides his horse and Violetta picks flowers for her greenhouse and feeds her white doves in their big cage. Cornell McNeil's bombastic but fatherly Giorgio Germont is a great support to the refined performances of Domingo and Stratas. The Flora's party scene is exceptional with even more visual beauty as Gypsies and bullfighters dance seductively and professional gamblers enjoy themselves. The closing ensemble is not to be missed and neither is the melancholy and tragic ending. Conductor James Levine leads the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus. Once again, this is the greatest and ultimate version of La Traviata ever made. It is a must have for opera fans and for curious non-opera lovers. Other films Domingo made after this film are Carmen in '84 and Verdi's Othello in 86. Teresa Stratas is the greatest Violetta and she will win your heart with her convincing performance as the sickly, passionate and self-sacrificing courtesan whose love for Alfredo redeems her and gives her happiness even if she dies at the end.",Positive
"As I understand it, this film was a revolution at the time, with Zeferelli opting for shooting as for a film rather than filming a stage production. As another commentator commented, the miming is not always perfect and lip movements and sung words don't always match. However, the sound of one of Verdi's greatest operas is wonderful and the soloists are great. Domingo is in his prime here, not only a splendid voice but also a great actor, and Teresa Stratas does an equally great job as Violetta. The production is gorgeous, a feast to the eye as well as the ear, and the party scene, with two stars of the Bolshoi Ballet in the starring dancing roles, is absolutely breathtaking (""He really didn't do that, did he? Omigosh, he did it again!""). A must for all lovers of opera.",Positive
This adaptation of Verdi's opera La Traviata is simply sumptuous and a lavish production. Never before than an opera is transformed into a beautiful film. Ms.Stratas and Mr. Domingo performed and sings with pure gusto and it is a sheer delight. Set designs and costumes are a credit to the production and director Zeffereli excels in his delivery of this opera and presents it as a movie experience. Music performed by The Metropolitan Opera orchestra conducted by James Levine and the music thoroughly shines all the way through.I truly enjoyed this film experience and enjoy the music and performance.,Positive
"AAT is one of the best animated movies from the 1980's, and also a Don Bluth masterpiece.Many animated movies is getting too blended with CGI, and it failed like in Pocahontas, but AAT is nicely animated without any use of a computer.",Positive
"Fievel Mouskawitz and his family emigrate to America because in their native Russia the Cossack cats menace them while the Cossacks menace the Muscowitz family of humans under whose porch they live. But Fievel gets lost from the rest of his family during a giant storm that looks like Neptune himself has gotten angry.Fievel survived the storm in a bottle, although even he apparently did not know how he got into the bottle. He washes up on the plinth of the Statue of Liberty, which is being built by a French seagull. (OK, then Siegel. We get a lot of Jewish jokes in here, without ever once actually saying they are Jewish.) The seagull admonishes him to ""never say never"" when he gets discouraged about ever being able to find his family, and then recruits some French floozy pigeons (passenger pigeons?) to carry Fievel to the mainland.Fievel is a very appealing little guy, with a totally cute way, cute voice, cute everything. You may get a little tired of cute by the time the film is over. Fievel's father had told him that there were no cats in America, but they found early on that it was not true. So even though they come close to each other several times, we follow the adventures of Fievel on the one hand and the rest of his family on the other as they become involved in a plot to get rid of the cats in New York.He meets Tony, a street-wise Italian-American mouse who nicknames him Philly, and they go off to try to find his family. They hear an Irish colleen mouse speaking out from a platform which is actually a straw boater hat as she tries to rouse the mice to work together to get rid of the cats. That was the first Fievel learned that there were indeed cats in America. Meanwhile, Tony falls hopelessly in love with the colleen, and rather neglects poor Fievel.Once again, it's too much fun to ruin it by telling you too much of the plot. Things get a little syrupy here and there, but you will love where the voices of Madeleine Kahn and Dom DeLouise show up. I didn't recognize the names of any of the others, but you can't miss those two.",Positive
"This is a wonderful movie. I'm a huge Don Bluth fan. This is a story reliving the history of our country through a young Russian mouse. It's a beautiful story with fabulous music and beloved characters. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll awe in wonder as the mice rally together to defeat the cats. (May not be an ideal movie for a cat-lover.) Definitely worth watching.",Positive
An American Tail is a Classic that will be remembered for a long time to come by all who see it.  My girls both loved this cartoon and now my foster children also enjoy seeing it.  The art work was great and the sound was right on.  Thanks for making an enjoyable video.,Positive
"Since we bought this when it was first on VHS (after watching the movie when it first opened) this is a replacement.The story is very cute as are the characters except for the villain, who's a cat. My daughter love this and used to watch it several times a month. It has remained one of her favorites even though she is now a SR in college (majoring in chemistry).The colors were vibrant and the animation is super! Voice talent was superb, including Dom Deluise. I would rate this a very high 9.0 to 9.25 out of 10 stars.I highly recommend this!!",Positive
This was a favorite of mine when my children were growing up. It was put out on VHS. I was thrilled to find it available on DVD which saves me the trouble of having to transfer the VHS through a third party chain store.,Positive
"This is in the Old Style Disney. These are wonderful, memorable, meaningful characters. And, like any good film, it's about courage, love, family, and friendship overcoming the darker forces of our nature.  Love this film. I am thoroughly happy to have this as part of my Disney library.",Positive
"This animated featured, directed by Don Bluth, is an unforgettable treat for the entire family.  It follows the adventures of ""Fievel,"" a little boy mouse who journeys from Russia to America with his family, late in the 19th century, to seek a new life free of cat persecution.  (Some analogies are present here.)  During the storm boat trip, Fievel is lost at sea, and he finally washes up ashore in New York Harbor, where he vows to find his family.With the voices of Dom DeLuise, Madeline Kahn, Nehemiah Persoff, and Christopher Plummer, this story will warm your heart.  A highly recommended movie!!!",Positive
I grew up on this movie as a kid and bought it to share with my nieces and nephews. They love it! Great cartoon with a great story.,Positive
"As you can tell i love the storytelling of this lovable and moving story of a Russian mouse family and their trials in America.  This is simply a delightful tail (tale)of family, survival, and reunion.  Enjoy the movie!",Positive
"Oh, I remember watching this movie! I remember when Fievel and his family were going to the United States from Russia, but turns out that they lost each other. Eventually they reunited. I always love the song ""Somewhere out there""...... Dom DeLuise was hilarious in this film. love him!",Positive
"Brilliantly animated, warm and tender, this movie is one of the few greats that Bluth did before he started putting out trash. Unless you don't like animated movies and are more into snakes and spiders, you WILL fall in love  with Fievel. Tiger is also another hit. While not as lovable as Jeremy from  The Secret of Nimh, he's more lovable than Itchy from All Dogs Go to  Heaven. Some of the elements that get amplified in Bluth's more poorly  crafted movies show up in this movie, but they don't detract from the  quality of this altogether enjoyable film.",Positive
I had fun going back to my childhood memories. There is a favorite scene I have. 5 Words. THE GIANT MOUSE OF MINSK!,Positive
"This was definitely one of the better animated films of the 90's, about a immigrant mouse family that comes to America for a better opportunity. While this film certainly doesn't capture the whole picture of immigration, it gives a sense of it, and what immigrants had to deal with, from trying to establish a new home, to the discrimination they often faced from natives. Overall a good film.",Positive
"When I was a little bitty kid back in the day (around the late 80s and the early 90s) I loved this movie so much. Everyday I came home from kindergarten I watched this in the late afternoon. I used to sit on the living room carpet, back against the couch and sing &quot;Somewhere Outthere&quot; over and over and over again. The movie was just good to me. I adored it. If I have kids, I would show them this movie because it's touching and it's universal. Recommended.",Positive
"First of all, i'm glad to see that i'm not the only not-kid (i'm 19) that still loves this movie and that cried when seeing it again...It's a great movie to see when you are a child, and a great movie to see through your life, until you could watch it with your own children.It's also an important movie: A friend of mine had a history teacher that said that this movie shows greatly the lives of the immigrants to America, so you'll also get a bit of history with it.",Positive
"I just dropped in here to say that this is a great one for the entire family -- this animated film is NOT generally boring to adults and, of course, kids love this one.Fievel Mousekiwicz (or however it's spelled) is a Russian mouse who charms the socks off all who watch him. Great animation in this one!Don't miss this ""film opportunity"".",Positive
"Wow. This is one of those animated movies you won't soon forget. With a wonderful score by James Horner, great story, and admirable characters, this is right up there with Disney's best.Basic plot: Boy gets separated from his family on their way to America by boat and must find his way back to them. On his journey, he meets new friends and enemies in one grand adventure in New York. Oh, did I mention the main character and his family are mice? Watch it and enjoy.",Positive
Bought this for my daughter-in-law for a gag Christmas gift.  This was her favorite childhood movie.  Her eyes lit up when she opened it.  You never know who grew up with which movies.  It pays to ask.  I was thrilled to find it for her on DVD so she can share it with her kids.,Positive
"It's amazing that Steven Spielberg doesn't get more recognition for producing one of the greatest animation movies of all time.  Although the story is very simple, it rings true on so many different levels.  The contrast of the Mousekowitzes with actual human turn of the century immigration experiences is poignantly done.  A cartoon where you really care about characters.  Great for the kids.",Positive
"Fievel is a young Russian mouse separated from his parents on the way to America, a land they think is without cats. When he arrives alone in the New World, he keeps up hope, searching for his family, making new friends, and running and dodging the cats he thought he'd be rid off. An American Tail easily one of the best animated features ever made, but it proves to be leaps beyond the efforts of recent Disney movies by refusing to be constricted to an all too familiar formula. A heartwarming story, beautiful songs, great performances and the animation is stellar. This is an excellent movie for all ages that will warm your heart",Positive
great movie from Don Bluth that has a lot of historical accuracy when teaching about the 1800's but also a great fun movie,Positive
Educational and fun for both children and adults. Most everything Mr. Spielberg is connected to is 5 star.,Positive
"It's easy to forget about `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' when you consider that it was released the same year as possibly the greatest Disney film of all time, `Beauty and the Beast'.  It was just smothered by the affections given to another and many seem to dismiss this as a lesser film, when it is only lesser by a smidgen.  I mean, in all honesty, 1991 birthed two animated gems...two animated masterpieces, and `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' was one of them.`Fievel Goes West' tells the story of young mouse Fievel and his family, living in the sewers of New York City.  Fievel and his family along with the other mice in their community are told of lavish cheese paved roads out west and are persuaded to make a move.  Unbeknownst to them, they are being hoarded by a smooth talking feline determined to eat them up.  Fievel discovers this scheme, but a series of events finds him separated from his family with little hope of saving them, until he stumbles onto a legend who just needs a little nudge in the right direction.`An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' is one of the sequels that actually tops the original and lingers longer than one may have expected.  It is heartfelt, earnest and beautifully captured with effective voice acting, colorful animation and a killer original song (Dreams to Dream is beautiful, sincere and affecting).  This is one of those glorious childhood memories that only grows stronger as I advance in adulthood.  Carrying themes of love, family, loyalty and survival, it is a great film for the whole family and is certainly one of the very finest films to be released in the film year that was 1991.  Considering how strong of a film year that was, it is a huge compliment to say that `An American Tale: Fievel Goes West' should have probably landed on Oscar's Best Picture ballot, alongside the masterpiece `Beauty and the Beast'.",Positive
"In the first tale, Fievel got lost in New York, in this one, a shyster cat has sinister plans for the mouse community and sells tickets to a town out west. Fievel's family head west in the hope of a better life, but on the journey Fievel catches wind of the plot and in escaping the cats gets lost in the desert. He escapes a scorpion and is inadvertently rescued by a tribe of native mice from the clutches of a hawk when he finds his old friend Tiger, a cat who has ventured west to reunite with his girlfriend and somehow got caught by these same tribal mice and is mistaken for a god. Together, they finally make it to town to reunite with Fievel's family and he discovers his older sister has become a singer in a saloon run by the same sinister cat that had abandoned him in the desert and is now working to complete the plan that endangers every mouse in town, including his family. He finds the legend Wilie Burp, but discovers that he is his own hero when Wilie trains Tiger to be a dog and Fievel joins them to take on the Cat gang and save the mice.",Positive
"This is my favorite Fievel movie, the dream of tanya becoming a singer and his best friend tiger finding love and sticking out for his little friend not matter what.! the whole storie is so good,..kids and adults can enjoy it.",Positive
"Love the storyline and all the different characters , The Fievel save the west !",Positive
"This sequel to ""An American Tail"" is a fine animated film full of Old West Americana; the stuff legends are made of. It is full of great characters and you may even soon forget that you are watching an animated film. The story and dialogue are that good! James Horner seems to have really come of age with this memorable score. It is as much homage to Copland as it is to the American West. This was James Stewart's last theatrical film. This is a good and entertaining family film, which expounds virtues of loyalty and honor. Highly recommended viewing!",Positive
"This is such a cute movie. My kids love watching it, as do I. There are some parts in there that make us laugh each time we see it.  I would recommend getting it for the family, especially if you liked the first &#34;American Tail&#34;.",Positive
"The first American Tail movie was better, but this is definitely worth checking out. While the first movie touched on immigration and starting over in a new place, this film focuses on the challenges of going west. If you liked the first film, you should be able to enjoy this as well.",Positive
"Here we have a non-Disney movie that ranks right up there with some of the really great animated flicks. Jimmy Stewart and Dom DeLuise are no longer with us, unfortunately. Their characters are great. Linda Ronstadt's singing is superb. You do not watch this movie for the plot. Just enjoy the super characters with wonderful voiceovers.I never saw the first or the third installment of the Fievel series, and I'm sure they are great too. I had this on video tape and have been waiting for DVD for years. My daughter loved it, but she didn't KNOW the characters like I did. If I remember correctly, Spielberg was involved in this film, which makes perfect sense why it was done so well.It is not a Pixar magic cartoon, but it is just as enjoyable as any Pixar movie ever made, and I have all of those too. If you aren't a happy person, don't watch it, because you won't get the point of it. Try it, you might just really like it.",Positive
"What a great film! Just as good as the original but geared more towards kids. With another amazing score from James Horner, how can you go wrong?",Positive
"Cute, cute movie.  My grandkids enjoy watching it over and over.  This will remain in our library for a long time.",Positive
"WE HAVE ALL THE FIEVAL MOVIES, MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THEM, ESPECIALLY THE BIG GLD CAT, SHE LOVES SEEING FIRVEL GET IN TROUBLE AND OUT AGAIN",Positive
This is a really cute children's movie in this series. It's the next one after an American tail. In this one we find the mouseskewitz heading west taking a train hoping life will be better than in New York. On the way to the train station to head west to Green River Fievel falls off the train. Meanwhile Miss Kitty Tiger's love interest tells Tiger she's heading west as well. Tiger decides he's going to head west to follow them and he falls off the stage. Both Fievel and Tiger wind up in the desert and eventually meet up and the adventure goes on from there. It's an interesting story and it's full of adventure for the little ones. It is defintely worth getting.,Positive
"Instead of The Doors Collections this set should have been called 3 for 1, a joking reference to the song 5 to 1. This DVD is three previously released videos from the 80's and early 90's, Dance On Fire, Live At The Hollywood Bowl, and The Soft Parade.Dance On Fire is a slow start for the DVD, it is formatted like a 60's era LP, a collection of songs strung together that may or may not have a connection to each other. Jim Morrison once suggested that between tracks on a Doors album they should put some of his poems which is exactly what happens here between each video is a poem by Morrison.Some of the video's are rare such as the rarely seen Elektra promotional film of Break On Through. Others were created in the 80's, directed by Ray Manzarek with the specific intention to be video's shown on MTV, such as Wild Child, and surely the centerpiece of this is meant to be L.A. Woman. L.A. Woman is almost entirely shot by Ray without any vintage Doors footage and has a mini drama of a prostitute and a serial killer, with John Doe from the band X as the killer. It gets a little bogged down in the middle instrumental section as Ray gets in some esoteric artsy images. But it also has the iconic image of the L.A. highway at night, that looks like liquid light swarming around L.A. and Oliver Stone liked it so much ""borrowed"" it for his movie The Doors.Live At The Hollywood Bowl-filmed on July 5, 1968.The Doors gave this show at the Hollywood Bowl for Dave Diamond, a DJ who supported The Doors early on. Famously, Mick Jaeger and Keith Richard were in the audience that night so there might have been a little pressure on The Doors. Afterwards, a reporter is supposed to have asked Jaeger how he liked The Doors and he said `not really,' but this always sounded like rock star jealousy to me.The concert is The Doors on a somewhat sedate night, not that they weren't good but some of the theatricality and tension isn't there. What is really cool about this concert is that it's just the Hollywood Bowl footage, no editing from other concerts or performances to make the video more dynamic, and the sound is live.The highlight of this DVD has to be The End. Morrison starts with his famous rap to the light man, ""hey, Mr. light man turn down the lights,"" and has an extra poetic section about being at a party and there's an accident outside. It's classic Doors, and a very cool version of The End. Also, are bits of Celebration of the Lizard used as introductions to more well known Doors songs such as Light My Fire.The Soft ParadeThis is Ray's answer to Oliver Stone's The Doors movie. Ray has contended that Stone's movie didn't show the Jim Morrison he knew, the funny, articulate, thoughtful Jim Morrison.This section starts hot! With The Changeling and you're immediately swept into the world of The Doors, as they travel through airports, backstage and with their significant others. Ray's wife Dorothy is featured, as is Pam Courson (Morrison's cosmic mate)and Jim, and Robby's future wife.  We see The Doors in a recording session of the song Wild Child and you see a bit of how they built a song. The erudite Morrison is shown in the PBS interview with Richard Goldstein, and the humorous Jim, in a segment a minister at large confronts Jim and Morrison explains ""I can try to explain anything."" In this same section you're able to see a roadie picking cable and some sources think it's Harrison Ford making a few bucks before making it big, but you'll have to look quickly. And let's not forget Jim's backstage ode to Frederich Nietzsche as he pounds on a piano and recites a funny libretto about Nietzsche's life. And the video ends with The Doors performing The Soft Parade, which sounds almost too pretty for Jim Morrison to be singing until he takes it to the next level and makes it a ROCK song.One little shortcoming is that The Unknown Soldier is included in the Dance On Fire section and in The Soft Parade section and is essentially the same video and makes it a bit of a redundancy.A really weird thing about this DVD is that the menu doesn't appear until the end of the videos, but it does have a slew of bonus features that an avid Doors fan or a growing fan will want to see. The most prominent among these are Ray's films Evergreen, and Induction, which are very Godardesque films he made while at the UCLA film school. Induction features a party scene and if you look quickly you can see Jim Morrison as an extra in the scene.The bonus features also has the almost obligatory audio commentary which really doesn't add anything to the viewing of the videos. Ray can be pretentious at times, and Robby and John seem along for the ride. Although, Ray and John also have their own special features about a 10 minute clip from Densmore's one man play Riders On The Storm, and Robby presents a reworked instrumental of The End which sounds more Emerson, Lake, & Palmer. And Henry Diltz offers rarely seen pictures from the Morrison Hotel photo shoot with a five minute commentary.You really can't lose with this DVD. It has something for everybody from live performances, to Doors videos, to rarely seen films, it won't disappoint.",Positive
"When these first were released on VHS in the 80's, they alone almost cost $19, now you get 3 titles in one DVD!There is no 5.1 mix but it is 2.0 stereo.Manzerik made a few Doors videos in the ""Dance on Fire"" title, ""LA Woman"" is a nice piece of art.The collection shows many live performances and video clips, as well as interviews.The 3 films Combined you gives hours of enjoyment.  Until the remaining 3 members sit down for new interviews and create thier own Beatle-like verison of ""Anthology"", this DVD set is very acceptable.",Positive
this is part documentary and part concert. it has great sound and pictur quality. it has plenty of special features.,Positive
"The Doors Collection features 3 seperate programs originally released on VHS along with a multitude of special features as well as audio commentary from Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger, and John Densmore from the late 90's. The DVD runs about 3 hrs and also has an option for subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.The main body of this DVD contains Dance on Fire(1985), Live at the Hollywood Bowl(1987), and The Soft Parade(1991). Dance on Fire runs about 62 mins and features a collection of MTV-style music videos of various Doors songs. Live at the Hollywood Bowl is a complete concert that was recorded in 1968 and runs about 56 mins. The Soft Parade features plenty of personal footage of The Doors along with their wives/girlfriends and fans. This program runs 54 mins.The special features include a Memorabilia segment where a Doors fanatic describes various rarities. There is a Henry Diltz Photos segment where various Doors photos are shown along with comments from the photographer. John Densmore: Riders on the Storm has John doing a monologue about Morrison and playing some drums. Robby Kreiger: The End is Robby doing a guitar solo of The End. Evergreen and Induction are two student films of Ray Manzarek from UCLA around 1965.Song list from each program. Dance on Fire(Break on Thru, Light My Fire, People are Strange, Wild Child, La Woman, Unknown Soldier, Roadhouse Blues, Love Me Two Times, Horse Latitudes, Moonlight Drive, Crystal Ship), Doors at Hollywood Bowl(When the Music's Over, Alabama Song, Back Door Man, 5 to 1, Moonlight Drive, Celebration of the Lizard, Spanish Caravan, Wake Up, Light my Fire, The End, Unknown Soldier), The Soft Parade(The Changeling, Wishful Sinful, Wild Child, Build Me a Woman, Unknown Soldier, Soft Parade, Hello I Love You).Tremendous DVD collection encompassing a large body of work for this legendary band. I particularly enjoyed the surviving band member's little anecdotes and memories. After watching the entire program, it's nice to go back latter and just relax and listen to the 3 remaining members ""shoot the breeze"" about the past. I strongly recommend this DVD for all fans of The Doors as well as 60's era rock.",Positive
"The resolution isn't great but this collection gathers up 3 80's vintage Doors videos which are now out of print and adds some extras, so is worth picking up.",Positive
"If you want mythic Jim, watch Oliver Stone's film.This is a repackage of 3 existing Doors videos with some added material that rendered the videotapes obsolete.The ""Live At Hollywood Bowl"" shows a Doors concert with Jim in his prime and the theatrics that got them recognition instead of notoriety. The only disappointment is that it clocks in at an hour. Supposedly Harrison Ford was one of the cameramen at this show.""The Soft Parade"" features a post-Miami incident Doors on PBS with an excellent rendition of the title track.""Dance on Fire"" is a mix of live, spoken word and early music videos (aka promo film) that has most of the hits you know and love.The surviving members of The Doors add commentary, and the extras are pretty cool, including a student film by Ray Manzarek. I do think that they should have considered putting Jim's short film called ""HWY"" in this package as a bonus as well as the ""Feast of Friends"" documentary and the Isle of Wight performance that documented their last performance on film.",Positive
"AS ALWAYS, I LOVE GETTING MY HANDS ON FILE FOOTAGE THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. REALLY GLAD THAT I MADE THISPURCHASE.",Positive
"I had a lot of this collection on VHS. I sought to convert my collection to DVDs, but this collection hasn't been available until now. Apparently assembled under the watchful eye of Ray Manzarek, this collection adds footage to the VHS collection I had as it chronicles the evolution of one of LA's greatest bands.",Positive
"This album is a true and essential document that draws with absolute honesty the artistic path of this unforgettable ensamble. The work of edition is extremely intersting due includes some poems of Morrison that work out as introduction for the late song. You will watch to Morrison in high spirits more than once.The DVD is a compilation of several concerts, but also offers you interesting interviews where you can test the real approach of the whole band and evry one of his musicans. Robby Krieger, Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison were basically the soul of this band.Interesting album that must be preserved for the future generations.Maybe I would have wished a deserved farewell to Morrison in his grave in Paris, but I guess sooner or later, this hearfelt rendition will be made.",Positive
"Here is a great DVD for fans of The Doors!!! ""The Doors Collector's Edition"" conatins 3 awesome programs ""Dance On Fire"",""The Soft Parade"" and ""Live at The Hollywood Bowl""!!! Essential veiwing for Doors fans!!! Great extras too!!! Great picture and sound!!! Audio Commmentary by the surviving Doors members is also included on the three programs!!! Forget Oliver Stones film,THIS IS THE REAL DOORS!!! Classic stuff indeed!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+",Positive
"The Doors Collection (Collector's edition).  Get this for the ""Live at Hollywood Bowl"" performance and consider all the other stuff as wonderful bonus material.  This DVD will satisfy your Door's video desires but it also makes a great companion piece to the ""When Your Strange"" documentary (which is not a part of this collection).",Positive
"Well, My Sister bought me this DVD for X mas along with a t-shirt, and i must say it is great! The doors are my favorite band ever (im 25) and its great to see concerts from the past!I expected a doors concert to be like the CD's, Morrisons classic screams, yells and watever, but this concert is pretty mild, but great! I recommend this to any TRUE fan.",Positive
"In this review, I comment on this collection's three components separately, but I recommend the entire collection enthusiastically.  This is not only because I think it is great, but because there is so much material.  Perhaps you will find there is something you do not like, but you will find plenty to enjoy.Dance on Fire:  The viewer is laced by lead singer Jim Morrison's magnetism and a dark background as the promo video for ""Break on Through"" starts things off.  Later come the Doors' three most prominent TV appearances: on the shows of Ed Sullivan, Jonathan Winters, and The Smothers Brothers.  Morrison's poise is solid on all three.  The misty visuals for ""Moonlight Drive"" on the Winters show are great.  Morrison sang ""higher"" in ""Light My Fire"" after Ed Sullivan's censors had told him to change it to ""better"" for their show.  Contrary to what is shown in the movie ""The Doors,"" he sings ""higher"" softly the first time, but he then does sing it loudly in the climax.  ""L.A. Woman"" is infused with striking colorful scenes of Los Angeles; an Indian boy dances in ""Wild Child""; and a great collage supports the anti-war message of ""The Unknown Soldier."" Those who love ""The Crystal Ship"" can see Jim by the shore and also swimming in the river with a lady to an overdub of this pretty song. Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek directed ""Dance on Fire,"" the best of the three components here.Live at the Hollywood Bowl:  A dark backdrop envelopes the audience in this large venue as all lighting surrounds the Doors.  Jim Morrison has a commanding presence at the mike, and great posture, and he dances and moves around the stage with his own kind of grace.  His vest is yellow, his leather pants are brown, and his large western belt buckles shine. John Densmore's drums, as Densmore himself points out, are ""mod orange.""  Those who like Doors long cuts can enjoy good versions of ""The End,"" ""When the Music's Over,"" and ""Light My Fire.""  However, I can do without the full intro to ""The Celebration of the Lizard"" especially if, like here, it is not followed by ""Not to Touch the Earth"" (the only really good part of that theater piece).  The theatrics of ""The Unknown Soldier"" are great, with Morrison dropping to the stage, writhing in agony, after Robby Krieger ""shoots"" him with his guitar.  That makes up for the song's closing instrumental motif sounding too much like ""My Eyes Have Seen You"" Redux.The Soft Parade:  This includes a substantial amount of material from the 1969 PBS television show hosted by rock critic Richard Goldstein, just before the album ""The Soft Parade"" was released.  The Doors discuss rock music, but Jim's delivery has shortcomings.  Shown here are the show's performances of ""Wishful Sinful,"" ""Build Me a Woman,"" and the finale, ""The Soft Parade,"" on which a bearded Jim moves around with intensity.  Separately, a different video of ""Wild Child"" has the group rehearsing the song in the studio.  ""The Changeling"" is supported by a video collage showing the group in informal and formal moments.Audio commentary:  Krieger, Densmore, and Manzarek provide commentary for all three sections.  They sometimes discuss the footage, including activity during performance, outfits, instruments, venues, the songs, and the general environment.  At other times, they tell anecdotes and vignettes about many topics:  e.g., the ejection from Whisky a Go Go after Morrison's indiscretion performing ""The End,"" being signed by Elektra President Jac Holtzman, playing at The Ondine Club in New York City, and the Miami incident.  Among their lesser known stories is the group's being sued for plagiarism in ""Spanish Caravan""; Robby says he thought the riff was so generic (always played) that he did not imagine a French copyright would kick in.Bonus materials:  Self-driven Doors enthusiast Kerry Humpherys narrates for the viewer through a great visual display of Doors memorabilia.  Manzarek's two student films from UCLA are also part of the presentation.  Both star his soon-to-be wife, Dorothy Fujikawa, and in ""Induction"" one gets a brief glimpse of Morrison in a party scene.  Moreover, there are excerpts from Densmore's solo play on his life with the Doors, ""Riders on the Storm.""  Finally, Krieger does a guitar-only version of ""The End,"" helped by a percussionist and, on bass, Arthur Barrow, who has sometimes played with Robby in his solo career.  Word to the Wise:  If you own the three VHS's, you may not think the bonus materials justify a purchase of this CD unless you are a hard-core Doors person.  Well, perhaps together with the audio commentary they do.",Positive
This is truly a good Doors DVD. You get all their music videos.The 1968 Hollywood Bowl performance. A newly found print of Unknown Soldier which is a very beautiful video. The colors in the video really stand and out. There is also commentary on the main program and other partsof this DVD recorded with the surviving members of The Doors and Bruce Botnick. Very interesting commentary for a die hard Doors fan. This DVD went out of print a few years ago. Once i found that out i was going to buy my copy here.I guess Elecktra found some more copies of this on DVD cause Sam's Club was selling it in the summer of 2009. I quickly grabbed up a copy. All i can say is the videos have good sound. I think you can play the music vids and other programs in 5.1 surround sound.,Positive
"Morrison's misunderstood genius comes to fore in this DVD collection. Much of the videos remastered here are from Jim's film school days at UCLA when music videos were not even being imagined by the greater public. In fact, Morrison may have been the innovator of music videos prior to MTV and its very large following. Highly recommended for the curious these videos are genius at work long before the on set of music television!",Positive
"For any Doors fan, this DVD is a must have. It's got essentially every piece of footage ever shot of Jim Morrison (except for performances appearing on other DVD's). It's got an audio commentary by Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger, and John Densmore. And it's one of the most interesting and entertaining music DVD's ever. From a huge fan of The Doors standpoint.It's three separate segments (Dance on Fire, Live at The Hollywood Bowl,and The Soft Parade). ""Dance on Fire"" features the music videos forBreak on Through, People Are Strange, The Crystal Ship, and The Unknown Soldier. As well as Ray Manzarek's new video for ""L.A. Woman"" which captures the tone of the song perfectly. It also features the Ed Sullivan Show performance of ""Light My Fire"". The same one which was the subject of great controversy because Jim said the word ""higher"" on television. It also features a video for ""Roadhouse Blues"" which features some great shots of Morrison. The videos for Break on Through, People Are Strange, The Crystal Ship, and The Unknown Soldier are all great. Then we have the performance at The Hollywood Bowl. This is easily the greatest performance ever captured on film of The Doors. Jim Morrison puts on a brilliant performance, especially during the song ""The Unknown Soldier"" and""The End"" where he improvises a few lines. The final segment ""The Soft Parade"" begins with a montage of video clips to the background song""The Changeling"". Then we see some performances that were part of a PBS special, including the only video in existence of The Doors performing the song ""The Soft Parade"". There's also two interviews that were part of the PBS special where Morrison talks about his poetry/lyrics and accurately predicts the future of recording technology, which is very cool. The video ofJim improving a tribute to Friedirch Nietzsche is very cool too. Also, during the audio commentary we're shown a video of a few girls talking to Jim through the window of a car...Watch where that girls hand goes to...Also, this PBS special was featured on another Doors DVD called ""Soundstage Performances"" and for some odd reason, the video quality on this DVD is ten times better than it was on ""Soundstage Performances"". The audio quality has improved as well. Anyway, as for the Bonus Features; we get to see the two student films that Ray Manzarek directed while attending UCLA.One of them features a shower scene with a man and Ray Manzarek's wife,that Ray refused to cut causing Morrison to gain respect for him. There's some excerpts from John Densmore's one man play, which is actually pretty funny. One reviewer mentioned that it sucks (I'm paraphrasing here) to hearDensmore sing, because he can't. Well, no, he doesn't have a very good voice, but the way he's singing the songs are sarcastic to get the audience laughing. Turns out, Densmore is a pretty witty guy. Then there's an instrumental version of ""The End"" performed by Robbie Krieger, which is really great. It would be cool to her Jim's voice added to it for maximum effect though. There's also an interesting montage of photographs from the ""Morrison Hotel"" sessions with commentary by the photographer. It's pretty funny to learn how Morrison and crew went into a place called The Morrison Hotel and took some pictures when management told them not to. Another thing, I neglected to mention about the main audio commentary with Manzarek, Krieger, and Densmore is that it's obvious that these men loved Jim Morrison and still do. To hear them talk about the events taking place on the tapes with such loving affection is great. Also, I forgot to mention the video's for ""Wild Child"". The song's not my favorite ever, but it's pretty cool to see The Doors perform the song in the studio. Overall, this is the essential Doors DVD for The Doors fanatic. This is the definition of perfection.GRADE: A+",Positive
"If you are an avid Doors fan - get this DVD.  The narration by the remaining Doors members is very informative.  The new version of ""The End"" recorded in Arthur Barrow's studio(Lotek in Venice, Ca)is hypnotizing. If you want a behind the scenes update of ""The Doors"" - this is it.  I thought it was very interesting to see Ray Manzarek's apartment in Venice, Ca where they lived and Jim Morrison lived there with them for a while.  The films ""Evergreen"" and ""Induction"" that Ray put together while at UCLA was also intriguing. Too much great information, film, and music to list all here. Get it - you won't be sorry you did.",Positive
"It wasn't until about two years ago that I became aware of the existence of this DVD when I viewed it at a friend's house. There was so much here, I just had to have it. With nearly three hours of music and a couple of interviews, you really get bang for your buck. And that doesn't even count the extras!So if it is such a value, why did I give it only four stars? Well, in my view there is too much Soft Parade and not enough Morrison Hotel. And Morrison Hotel is arguably the best Doors album bar the debut. With so much time available on the DVD, surely more than Roadhouse Blues could have been squeezed in!The packaging is not lavish. You get only one disc and a useful insert with pictures and DVD info. But what a disc it is! The presentation has been broken down into three easy to digest sections so that the viewer can watch it in increments and not forget where they left off. Some of your favorites will be here, some probably won't. But except for the glaring omissions mentioned earlier, almost all of the ""hits"" are here as are some of the band's more obscure pieces.If you are a fan of the Doors, then The Doors Collection deserves a place in your video collection. Those who never got to see Jim Morrison and his band live when they were current can see what a Doors concert was all about and those who did can relive the glory days.",Positive
I enjoy high lights and music videos from back then. this is a great one to get if you like the doors.,Positive
"This is the perfect Doors collection.  Its very sad that there is so little actual film or video of the Doors during their short, very strange journey.  The first section is a nearly vital collection of TV appearances, including the legendary Ed Sullivan show.We also have the beautifully filmed Hollywood Bowl concert, which makes this collection a positive boon.  While it may be true that Jim wasn't exactly on form that night, its still pretty good (a test ... close your eyes and listen.)  ""When the Music's Over"" and the middle portion of ""Celebration of the Lizard"" show off the band at their weird poetic best.  Only the Doors, only Jim Morrison could get away with stopping a song mid-stream and yelling ""Wake up"" ... rambling into strange poetry back out into a song, pacing the audience, driving the tension up and up until the first drum snap of ""Light My Fire.""  The main let down comes with ""The End"".  Jim haggles with an unresponsive light man to turn the house lights down, ruining the mood.  Its humorous, but not exactly good.This DVD is three hour long video titles re-released.  But, if you owned those videos, you know that this is a bargain for the price.",Positive
"While not totally comprehensive, there's a lot of material here to absorb and enjoy. After you watch the DVD, be sure to check out the band commentary as it's awesome; lots of fun anecdotes and insight. I enjoyed the bonus extras as well; re: Manzarek student films, memorabilia gallery w/commentary and photo shoot for Morrison's HotelI hate to encourage a further money grab, but it would be nice to have a comprehensive ""ultimate"" collection w/everything available on one edition; not just material here, but all of The Doors available video stuff on one release. New menus, get rid of some the bad editing/silhouettes from Soundstage (if that's possible), new material (there's got to be some) etc. DMC is probably planning something like this for the future.",Positive
"Music Scene was supposed to be about the music of the time.  Of course, it was.  But, it was also about a political attitude and seems to have had its genesis in the perspective embodied in the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.  The show contained a lot of anti-Nixon political humor.  Irrespective of a viewer's political positions, whether one is liberal, radical, moderate or conservative, the problem here is that the humor is just not funny as delivered.  Both Bob Hope and David Steinberg employed politically-oriented quips in their approach to humor.  Perhaps some find this funny.  If you do, fine.  I find it boring.  This show and its companion, volume 2, are worth watching if you were not alive at that time and want to examine a thick slice of the culture.  My comments pertain to both volumes.As fun viewing, the show is a failure. It does not work, even as nostalgia. It's difficult to feel nostalgic listening to David Crosby implying the world would be a better place without oil companies.  Nothing like living on a commune! There is a vague emptiness I feel in watching these shows.  Perhaps it's because I wanted another Hullabaloo or Shindig, both of which were filled with convincing performances, great dancing and excitement. They made me smile.  This show has an entirely different atmosphere.  To use a term from that era, ""it's a downer.""  Aside from the alleged humor, the performances often fall flat.  One notable exception is Neil Diamond's delivery of Holly Holy.If you are curious about a facet of the culture and music of 1969-70, the show is worth viewing.  If, however, you want an enjoyable music and comedy viewing experience , I'd recommend the Dean Martin Variety Show as an alternative purchase. You won't stop smiling.",Negative
"These comments apply to both Music Scene dvds equally (this dvd and the other dvd).Disappointing collection of rock and pop performances. Mostly pop, unfortunately, and some of the worst (the Archies, Tom Jones, too many times Bobby Sherman). The program was run by BillBoard, the hit rating service still around today. Most of the musicians are second or third-rate.True, once in a while you get Crosby Stills Nash and Young, or Ten Years After, or Janis Joplin. But those acceptable performances are few, far between and a pitiful minority of the program. Plus often they aren't playing tunes you'd most like to hear, and they are playing them on stages that are wrong for them, that fail to showcase them. And what do you do with for instance, one measly song from CSNY? You need 3 or 4 to have the opportunity to enjoy it. The program forces Sly and the Family Stone to mush together its songs into a medley so rushed through you don't get a chance to savor it (heck, you question whether you even heard it).The people who put on the program selected their musicians disastrously, and apparently were rightly cancelled due to deservedly poor ratings.The show is somewhat interesting sociologically for those who experienced those times first hand. You are revisiting the TV culture of 1969, after all, for better or for worse. But that's about it. Save your money for a better purchase than this.",Negative
"Bambi, 1942 filmAdapted from the story by Felix Salten for America and the world of 1942. It opens on a gray murky world that soon changes to bright colors. Small furry animals appear, without any cares or concerns. What an idyllic world! How different from the events in front of the screen. This colorful land has only happy times. There is no unemployment, poverty, war, or hunger. April showers are followed by the sun's warmth. Bambi soon learns that there are places that are not safe, like the meadow (no mention of the danger). The scenes of the animal movements show artistic excellence; they must have cost a fortune. A flight of crows signal an alarm, and the deer flee into the forest. The danger is ""man in the forest"". [Isn't this just brainwashing young children?]The snows of winter arrive. More scenes of animal movements pad out this story. The tough times show the hungry deer stripping bark from the trees (doesn't this kill trees and damage the forest?). Shots ring out, and Bambi's mother is gone. Spring brings singing birds in preparation for the summer. Bambi has grown antlers, and has matured. He battles and wins his mate. But men have come into the land, and there is danger. A pack of hounds chase poor Feleen. Bambi arrives to save her, and they escape. But a shot hits Bambi, and he falls. Fire spreads from the camp into the forest, destroying their habitat. Most of the animals escape to an island in the lake. Bambi is reunited with Feleen, and twins are born.The excellent draftsmanship doesn't mask a weak storyline. I saw this as a child over 60 years ago, but remember little. This story was designed to be anti-hunting, and anti-human. Is such a perverse film fit for children? The depiction of those dangerous dogs may disturb some pet owners. What does this say about Walt Disney? The film does not show how man eliminated the wolves, panthers, and bears that preyed upon animals like deer. The film shows no conflicting interests, unlike the lawn outside where birds hunt and dispute their territory.",Negative
"This old Disney Classic gets lost among all the other movies for families that have a more upbeat story.  We rank this 31 out of the 41 Disney Animated movies that we own.  Once it was seen, the kids seldom selected this one to watch again.",Negative
"I never cared for the movie when I was young and it seems to be a pattern they don't even want to watch it. It is long, boring, and not fun at all. Just part of the collection",Negative
I bought this movie and had my three plus yr old watch it and I couldn't believe how terrified he was. I had to keep forwarding the scary scenes. I had no idea this was such an old movie. The music sounds like church music and is not something I consider for kids (Remember it is rated G). The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so. I think this is an age old format of story telling which needs to revised. Unfortunately Disney keeps repeating it through movies like Incredibles.,Negative
"Sorry, Peter, but I grew up.Actually, it's more than that. Wendy is not exactly a feminist, after all, and the Indians are not in any sense Native Americans. The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today. And it's too late for the dream of a boy who never grows up. We've heard about ""The Peter Pan Syndrome,"" and I even married one. That was Husband Number Three, actually.There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily. Even as a child, I didn't see the point to the fake combat against the Indians and the pirates. And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.I would not recommend this to your children and grandchildren, unless you are prepared to do a good bit of explaining the differences between 1953 and 2012.",Negative
"I hated this movie when I was young, but decided to watch it again with my children. This movie is just not what I want influencing my kids or myself, Tinekerbell is a murderous wench, Peter Pan is a jerk and I found myself bored during most of this movie.",Negative
I do not know how one can rate a dvd not released until March?????? I have the limed Issue of Peter Pan It Is a awesome collectable copy.Now all we have are remakes of all our best Disney dvds.To make more money for disney.And their 30.0000 Factories all over the world.,Negative
"I expect this akin to heresy but I didn't much like this film.  I never saw it as a kid but was certainly put off when I saw the iconic characters in their actual (animated) performances.Peter Pan is a bit of a punk, -- certainly not a role model for any child.Tinkerbell is downright malicious.  The mermaids aren't much better.The positive is that the voice actors do an incredible job.  Truly perfect performances throughout.The negative is that the script itself makes Never-Never Land seem like a dysfunctional playground.  Maybe that's the point, as I've not read the book this is based upon, but it doesn't fit well in my mind of a Disney classic, especially one that formed a major pillar upon which the entire Disney franchise was based upon.",Negative
"Honest to God being of the Woodstock generation I had Great expectations from this release, and was very disappointing with the resolution and the editing of this version. I was really looking for something that looked like at least somewhat close to the original theatrical release but this fell very short. The Audio is barely OK and sounds flat (dynamics are lacking in the music)and the added footage does not add much to the film.In addition I would be hard pressed to say it's a Hi Def film. The contrast in many parts is just poor, and no it's not my set. I have a newer set that was rated pretty high, and I have never had this issue in concert films. I guess I would say except on vintage poorly non Hi Def films that were poorly transferred. Over all I can not see anything about this making it look or sound like a newly Remastered Version Hi Def  release, Nothing!",Negative
Read the other reviews.I bought the VHS to see if it was better than the DVD. It is! Better video AND sound quality. Warner Home Video did a poor job on the DVD version. It is NOT truly widescreen (as you will see if you buy the VHS). It is more pan-and-scan full screen. You WILL get a better movie by buying the VHS and copying it to DVD.,Negative
"I am not a fan of split screen and that is what this is.  A split screen in HD is no better than a split screen in regular 480, with small images like this there is no real improvement.  I was never a fan of hippies either, but the music was why I bought this.  It is 1969 and this is nothing as good as the Mets winning the world series.  I can not get past the split screen, I made a bad error in judgement to buy it.  I will watch it once and forget about it.  I bought it because it was 26 bucks on special of the day...big deal, it's still bad filming and even worse post production.  Wow I can see the grainy cheap print in Blu-Ray!  Sound is 1969 Muntz 8 Track.  It sound awful on my really good home theatre surround.  Very disappointed, but it is about what I expected.  I blame myself for being so stupid.  I knew better!  Makes me want to go back to VHS.",Negative
"This DVD(s) was a disappointment in terms of selection. Only one song by Janis. No real songs by Crosby-Stills-Nash that were seen, only heard. A lot of the background stories are interesting. I agree that it does take you back to a time that will never return, which is sad.",Negative
"I bought this set with great expectations. However this turned very soon into a major dissapointment for the following reasons:1-Letterboxed single frame sequences. The split frame sequences are alright but the the single frame (around 50% of the film) are letteboxed all over the screen so you end with a pictire with a huge black frame around it for half a movie...the 1994 director`s cut is better2-The sound have not been improved at least comparing to the 1994 version3-The extra footage (really very few, some good performances by Mountain, Joe Cocker,CCR, Johnny Winter and the Airplane and way too much Country Joe McDonald )is not integrated into the film..The Who extras are almost a repeat of the previously released footage...they had 40 years to do it..lazy people Waldeigh and his team4-All available footage is not available here, there are other products that have extra songs not included into the set..they should have included all available ""in good shape"" footage in order to justify the price5-The featurettes (what a name for pieces of crap) sholud have been integrated into One mini-documentary for an even flow of the story they are trying to displayIn summary do not buy this set. Try to get the 6 CD boxed set (back to Yasgur`s Farm) that has very good sound, tons of good music in the correct sequence..still some missing songs available in other releases, but truer to the original concert",Negative
"The theatrical release had a GREAT Johnny Winter performance of 'Big Town Blues', one of my favorites. I bought this  after reading about all the 'extra' footage..stupid me, I never imagined that would mean  =deleting=  the -best- footage...Johnny's gone!",Negative
"I also have this movie in it's many various incarnations.  The Blu Ray 40th Anniversary, the original VHS and DVD release, as well as the director's cut DVD.  So I go and by this 40th Aniversary DVD for my office (which unfortunately does not have a Blu Ray player) specifically because I wanted the extra performances that are on the other 40th Anniversary discs.  Creedance, Johnny Winter, The Who, Canned Heat, Airplane, etc.  Wrong! Not here. Even the extra documentary footage that's on the other 40th Anniversary release of Wadleigh, Dale Bell, Scorsese and many others speaking on the events surrounding the filming of the movie is not here.  Just some cheesy Story of the Sixties film.  Totally dissapointed.  What really made me angry is that there's no disclaimer stating that there's huge differences between this ""40th Anniversary Edition"" DVD and the others that are available.  I just gave it away.",Negative
"I was thinking of buying this item, but after reading the reviews, and finding out just what is NOT included in it, I said SKIP it!! All the other bands that did not make it to the previous versions are NOT on here. I guess in order to see them you have to have a BLU-RAY player, which I don`t have, and in these tight times, do not plan to get.(In my opinion BLU-RAY is a waste of money, once you get used to it, you would`nt want to go back to standard, so your hooked on it and its higher prices). This is a NOT SO SPECIAL EDITION. How many years will it take before the regular people can have the full version. Maybe I`ll get the 50th anniversary version! PASSSSS!

"You unlock this cesspool with a key of insight-beyond it is another dimension, a dimension of egoism, a dimension of hedonism, a dimension of self entitlement. Your moving into a land of both thoughtlessness and insensitivity, you've just crossed over into the zone of baby boomers.Witness a theatrical musical festival-the year is 1969. Put on by a bunch of characters who ""for the most part"" have no more character than what you might find described and pictured on an FBI poster at your local post office. For the rest of their pathetic lives, they will boast and brag about what a historical and meaningful event took place at Woodstock N.Y. and how great it was to be there. Sadly, all these delusional pathetic characters were never at Woodstock-although they may try to convince you, but the festival never took place in Woodstock N.Y. It took place 100 miles away in a town called Bethel, New York.This festival portend the social nassissistic self-indulging climite that now pollutes American culture.",Negative
"I adore this movie and have since my teens, and had been waiting for at least 10 years for it to come out on DVDBut now I have a copy it will not play.

"A particular Elvis fan favorite? C'mon! I'm a huge Elvis fan, but this lousy film is in no way better than his previous films, except for the aspect of eye candy for the guys...in the form of Ann Margret. She is definitely the star of this movie, and it's quite obvious that the director purposely exploited Margret's beautiful face and figure to overcompensate for the terrible script. It starts off interesting enough, albeit quite corny in places (especially in the songs), but I expected that and accepted it for what it was. However, the story just gets weaker and weaker, until the end where the time span between the climax and the end of the movie is about 30 seconds. And absolutely no twists or turns in the plot to make it interesting...just blah, the end. Just an awful movie, sorry.I really like Jailhouse House and King Creole--those were great flicks, and not just compared to Elvis's other movies. Even Blue Hawaii was much better than Viva Las Vegas. 4-1/2 stars as an overall rating??? Unbelievable. I guess all 4-1/2 stars go to Ann-Margret rather than the movie in general. If you want to salivate over a young, hot Ann-Margret, I recommend this movie. If you want an overall good movie, you won't find it here.",Negative
"When it comes to finding good sequels, it's a tough challenge. When it comes to finding good animated sequels, you will have even more difficulty because you must swim through an ocean of crap generally polluted by Disney sequels as well as other miscellaneous animated films you forgot existed. I'd have to say my personal favorite animated sequel ironically is All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 which I felt was unfairly victimized by fans of the original (Even though I'm also a big fan of the original, and it is certainly better). Despite the gaping plot holes in that film, it managed to work as a standalone film and I managed to thoroughly enjoy it. However, The Secret of Nimh 2: Timmy To The Rescue pretty much deserves the criticism it got. Not only does this film not work as a sequel that pales considerably compared to its nearly flawless predecessor, it doesn't work as a standalone film. This is definitely not one of the rare exceptions of animated sequels, but it's just like most of the others; IT SUCKS. While the film isn't quite as bad as you've heard (There are Disney sequels that are much worse), that doesn't mean you should watch it.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The makers of this film felt that it was necessary to alter events from the first film, claiming that at some point the leader of the rats in the first film; Nicodemus laid out a prophecy saying that Timothy Brisby is destined to be a hero that follows in the footsteps of his father (When did this happen? I've watched the first film dozens of times, and there was no such prophecy!). So, when Timmy becomes of age he is sent off to Thorn Valley to be taught the basics to one day be a great hero by characters from the first film such as Justin and Mr. Ages. He isn't particularly happy with what he's been taught and he doesn't bother to listen at times. When he's brought with Justin and other rats on a scouting mission to find food (Didn't they promise they weren't going to steal anymore?), the group is almost killed when Timmy wanders away from his post and meets a female mouse named Jenny (With breasts for some odd reason) who can read. It is discovered that she came from NIMH, where the missing six mice are still located (The mice that were supposedly killed during the escape from NIMH when they were sucked down a ventilation shaft, but it turns out that landed in the basement on a mattress. HOW CONVENIENT!). When the council of Thorn Valley rejects going to NIMH to save the mice, Timmy and Jenny run away to go and rescue the mice at NIMH with the help of old friends (Jeremy the crow, as well as others) and some new ones (Floyd the annoying caterpillar), but it's more personal since Timmy must rescue his older brother Martin from NIMH as well. Sadly, the plot just isn't interesting like the first film. Nothing in the dark fantasy world of the first film could have prepared you for the true horrors that lie in this film.MUSIC: The score itself isn't so bad, but I sorely miss Jerry Goldsmith's presence because the music he wrote for the first film was practically perfect. However, that's not what kills this area. The real killer of this film is the musical scenes. Of the 5-6 songs in this film, only two are actually good (Just Say Yes and All I Had Is Gone). All of the other songs are torturous and will literally make you cringe and squirm because they're so awful. The other songs are not clever, they are not catchy, but in fact, written by Satan himself. This is what happens when you turn a sequel to a film that was never a musical to begin with.ACTING: Most of the voice-actors aren't bad, which is why I can't blame them for the bad dialogue. No one could make most of this dialogue sound good. Only two actors from the previous film reprise their roles (Dom DeLuise as Jeremy and Arthur Malet as Mr. Ages), and you will sorely miss the voice-actors from the first film (The new voice-actor for Justin is the worst of them all, he's completely God-awful). However, most of the voice-acting for the most part is passable, and it does seem at times these actors try to save this awful, ham-fisted script, but no amount of acting abilities could save it.ACTION: The animation by itself isn't so bad, until you compare it to the animation of the first film which released sixteen years prior to this sequel. How in the hell does the first film look vastly superior to this sequel? It came out in 1982 for godsake! I also noticed odd frame-rate problems in the animation in which at times it seemed too slow or too fast and the camera couldn't keep up with it. Sadly, unlike its predecessor, this film is either boring, filled with awful musical scenes, or it tries to be more action-packed (Wow! Explosions! Surely this will make up for the lack of a good plot, character development, music, and well, everything!). This film has been noticeably toned down in terms of violence compared to its predecessor, such as in the introduction of the film that shows scenes from the first film that have been altered, with the violence cut out and at the same time altering events. It was reported that MGM thought the first film was too scary for kids, so they made this sequel as stupid as possible. Congratulations, MGM, mission accomplished! There's never a single point in this film in which you will ever care about these lackluster and uninteresting characters (Yet one idiotic raving review on this site called Timmy an ""inspirational"" character, which he is far from). In fact, at times, you'll be rooting for the bad guys because they're a lot cooler and hoping they'll just kill everyone off.OVERALL: With a lack of a good plot, practically no ties with the original film except for character names with such characters being put in boring situations, awful musical scenes, mediocre animation, and no real character development, we are left with a nonsensical mess that will only please small children and no one else. This is yet another bad sequel to a great animated film that is very unmemorable and very little effort was put into making it any good. By the way, if you're one of those people who adamantly claims that this sequel is better than the original... YOU'RE AN IDIOT. This film can't hold ground as a sequel nor as a standalone film, and will forever be condemned to bargain bins at video stores. As said before, you're better off keeping this sequel's existence a secret, because this is one secret best left secretive. Too bad.THE GOOD: The musical score by itself isn't so bad, there are a couple of good musical scenes, and okay voice-acting.THE BAD: Awful and nonsensical plot, no character development, bad dialogue, most musical scenes are awful, sub-par animation, annoying voice-acting, and it tries to be action-packed.",Negative
The Secret of NIMH was a dark story filled with dark acts and even darker characters.  Secret of NIMH 2 is a complete and utter disgrace.  NIHM 2 has nothing in common with the oringal.  Timmy would've been better of dead then star in this awful movie.,Negative
"I saw this on Youtube before watching the genius that was the first Secret of NIHM and holly s***! This is far, far from being anything like the first. For one this isn't made by Don Bluth, but a different company called Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation who are known for All Dogs Go To Heaven 2 (I loved this movie) and some movies I never heard of which is probably a good thing. This movie took the name of the first movie and raped it. Shoot it shouldn't even bare the name Secret of NIHM.You know somethings wrong as soon as you see the title. It gives a brief summary of the first film as told by Nicodemus prophesizing that one of the Brisby children is to save thorn Valley from NIHM. then the epic Secret of NIHM title is shown, but that epicness is quickly blown out the window as TIMMY TO THE RESCUE appears at the bottomXD So out of place. Instead of making a gritty, but artistic styled movie like the first, they went with stupid, cute, and just plain ridiculus. It just destroys what the first movie was all about. The editing is complete crap. Theres actually a person on Youtube (ThePS2God) who counted how many times they crossfade throughout the entire movie. Thier just so damn annoying. The characters from the previous movie don't even look the same. The design for the Brisby children are hideous. they even recycle characters. In the first musical number there are some characters in the scene that we're not even supposed to know about until later on! Thier not even supposed to be in the same area! Jeremy isn't enough to save this movie. The Great OWl is mentioned, but nowhere in the movie. If you do watch you'll see what replaces the Great OwlXDYou want to know what else? Mrs. Brisby is barely seen in the f-ing movie! Instead our main protagonist now is Timmy. You remember Timmy? He was the little mouse who was sick in the last movie. They came up with some BS story about how hes destined to be a hero like his father who saved the Rats in the previous movie from NIHM. If the cliche plot isn't enough they turned it into a f***ing musical!! AHHHHH!!! Prepare to be earraped everybody. The songs with the exception of maybe the one sung by timmy are horrible. Also notice in Timmys song how the first kids singing sound aweful than in the next scene the voice actor change. That tells me they knew the kids singing sucked big time. Theres also a Big Lipped Aligator Moment later on when this pointless Caterpillar thing sings this terrible musical number. It had no other purpose than to make this shi-ite longer than it has to be.The dialogue is also horrendous. At the beginning when Timmys scolded by a certain old Mouse who shouldn't even be alive at this point in time quates ""That its ok for guys to wear the same underwear 3 days in a row"". WTF did that come from. Theres alot of jokes in this movie that just fall flat on thier a**. Don't even get me started on the rest of the horrible dialogue. Timmy says alot of stupid things in this movie and do as many stupid things.To put the icing on cake in one musical scene near the end of the movie where Timmy and the pointless female mouse do a duet together, it rips off a certain Don bluth film about a another young mouse who duets with female mouse (coughAmericanTalecough). They don't even hide the fact that its a rip off. It even does the split screen bit that this particular movie does. They try to be depressing with this painfully 3 minute scene, but fail completely>.&lt;There are many more problems I have with this movie, but if i named them all this review will be a novel. After watching this i see why fans of the original pretend this doesn't exist. ITs almost up there with the 3 infamous animated Titanic movies. Hell I didn't even know it existed until the internet. If you don't want to be traumatized, Innorance is bliss. If you're curious enough to watch this save your money and just go watch it on Youtube for free.",Negative

"English singer songwriter Robyn Hitchcock (no relation to Sir Alfred) became a cult performer in the 1980s through the American college radio circuit. He made during that time some good, though perhaps overrated, records. Their lyrics were odd and eccentric, the music somewhat reminiscent of the rock of the late 60s (Pink Floyd legendary founder Syd Barrett is a name that came up in many profiles about him). In 1998, he decided to make a concert film, directed by none other than Jonathan Demme, who has directed the Talking Heads' widely acclaimed Stop Making Sense. Unfortunately, this movie is really disappointing, a concert film as dull as it can possibly be. We have a single camera fixing at an uninspired Robyn blurting out his songs with an acoustic guitar in a stage set in a deserted shop (thus the title, I guess). There is no audience inside, but wee see the people on the street outside passing by, occasionally stopping and looking what is going on inside. The songs are punctuated by some unfunny and rambling comments by Robyn. Unless you are a committed Robyn fan, you can safely skip this.",Negative
"Pointing a camera out a window on to a NY city street is nice as is the colored transparency seen later in a couple of songs. Just don't expect great guitar playing. Come on, he strums along to his folk songs for an hour and then picks up his electric for a few songs toward the end. Its like Bob Dylan meets Ian Hunter only without any of the hits. Definitely for devoted fans only.",Negative
This CD seems too &#34;disjointed&#34;---it does not flow seamlessly as we had hoped. We were searching for somethingto let us ease into restful sleep but this is not it.

We were hoping more for highly relaxing music that flowed into &#34;sleep&#34;.We found the voice in this CD not relaxing.,Negative
and try to figure out what strange music I was listening to.  I am better off with white noise.,Negative
"In fact, it made me feel kind of anxious at times.  I normally use a ""guided imagery"" CD to help me sleep (Belleruth Naparstek), but sometimes I get bored with it, so I wanted to try something different.  ""Delta"" certainly is different. I wouldn't call it music, but rather a a variety of long, slow sounds that sort of remind me of 2001, a Space Odyssey. I am glad that many people have found it soothing, but I simply could not get on the right wave-length; in fact, I did not sleep a wink using the ""Delta Sleep System"". So I put Belleruth back in my CD player, and listening to her velvet voice conjure up images in my mind, was asleep before the end of the CD. I have a very over-active mind, and I basically need something verbal to focus on and distract me.  I've tried ""real"" music too, like slow classical-type music, with no luck. However I do like Steve Halpern's random music--including his version of ""Brahm's Lullaby"" and sometimes I can sleep to it.  But ""Delta"" is not the ""change"" I need.",Negative

"Ladies and Gentlemen -- Unless you want a memento of Dame Joan Sutherland's last performance, I agree with another reviewer who said DO NOT BUY THIS DVD.  The opera is boring and senseless, the production and direction is acceptable at best, and the singing -- well, lets just say it leaves much to be desired except for Amanda Thane.  Clifford Grant was painful to listen to most of the time and while Anson Austin (tenor lead) has most the notes, he has no clue how to sing convincingly.  Dame Joan was shaky and only appears in Acts 2 &amp; 3 of this 5 act opera.  Acts 4 &amp; 5 are mislabeled as only Act 4 on the DVD insert.  If you want to see La Stupenda in something worthwhile, try the Norma or Anna Bolena with the Canadian Opera Company or her Lucia from the Met.  MAYBE, the only redeeming thing on this DVD is the 28 min. credit cue point at the end when she is on stage AFTER the performance is over.",Negative
"I cannot describe the travesty done to this opera.  The beauty is lost.  1) the location is moved from a magic world of nymphs to a victorian bedroom.  Why?  2) The opera is sung in English but there are no subtitles so that most of it cannot be understood.  The color is reasonable.  The image clarity is good, but I think it is unwatchable because of the miserable, juvenile pretentions of the director.",Negative
"I concur with the negative opinions already expressed.First the positives: beautiful music, Wagnerian with a lyrical twist.The negatives: first off: maybe I'm spoiled, but in this day there is no reason for an opera DVD NOT to have subtitles (I hope the double negative makes sense). The fact that it is sung in English is no excuse, especially when Rusalka or the Princess is going full-bore in some big ensemble. (Loud sopranos are more difficult to understand than loud male voices.) I understood maybe one-third of the libretto. Given the heavy reinterpretation given this staging, the listener needs all the clues he/she can have. Fortunately, the Met Opera web site had a synopsis that filled in some holes. That's one star off there.Secondly, the production makes hash of the story. While some of the negative comments of one of my fellow reviewers seems to me to be nitpicking, the general thrust seems to be valid: there is no way to integrate the story, what you see on stage, and what you hear.In the first place, if I hadn't read the blurb on the DVD case (one or two sentences long) outlining the Freudian interpretation, there is no way to see it in the staging. The story interprets the staging, not the other way around.In the second place, based on this Freudian view, the ending makes no sense. Are we to believe that Rusalka should have never grown up? Or, are we to say that all men are jerks, all women are ..., and that ""coming of age"" sexually will transform women into demonic seductresses who will inevitably kill men? Huh????!!!That leads to my third criticism of the staging: a fairy story only works AS A FAIRY STORY. Since Tolkien (Lord of the Rings) is all the rage right now (January 2004), let me invoke him: to allegorize a fairy tale is to kill it. One must let the mythic archetypes stand on their own, speaking their own truth, telling their own story.The mis-staging costs another star.Generally, we have a four star DVD here, but these errors, 4-2 = 2 stars.P. S. In checking around on the web for more info on this work, I've learned that there is a new DVD of Rusalka with Renee Fleming in the title role. Unfortunately, at the time of this writing it is only available in UK. Hopefully we can get it soon. Wait for it.",Negative
"Let me start by saying that I have never seen any performances of Rusalka besides this one. Maybe if I had seen a normal performance before this one, I might enjoy it more. I doubt it though.  There are many things that just are done poorly. As said before this is an interpretive production. The interpretation does nothing but confuse me. I never know where any of the scenes are taking place. The scenery is all pretty much the same, except for certain objects on stage that are supposed to create different settings for the different scenes. Most of the scenes have very little scenerey, making this production incredibly boring, seeing a huge stage with harly anything filling it up. The first scene appears to take place in a nursery, but there is a big hole in the floor with a pond underneath. Isn't the nursery supposed to represent the life under the lake? If so why is there a lake/pond in the middle of the floor? Aren't they already &quot;underwater.&quot; Why does Rusalka sing &quot;Song to the Moon&quot; with her back to the moon? In the second act, there is a glass cube witha single bed in it. I guess this is a bedroom. Whose bedroom is it? How come when the prince is supposed to straddle Rusalka and choke her it looks like he is so weak that he would be incapable of choking a small animal? Why is the glass bedroom right in the middle of the ballroom during the dance scene? Why is there a backdrop of the sky during the ballroom scene? Those are just some questions that occur to me when I watch this performance.  As said before, this is an English translation of the Czech libretto, and it is pretty obvious. The text just doesn't fit well with the music at all. There are also no subtitles to help with the parts that are difficult to hear, which are many. The sound is also very shaky. There is a constant flutter throughout the performance. It is most audible when one of the woodwinds holds out a long note. The acting performances are horrible. I blame the director, though. The acting is just extremely overexaggerated in the facial expressions and movements which is a common tendency for many actors which is usually remedied by a good or even mediocre director. I think the casting for the prince was a mistake too. He looks about twice the age of Rusalka, and should have been cast as one of the hunters that accompany the prince in the first act. His mullet and ugly moustache look anything but regal. Not the kind of guy you would give up your immortality and your voice to be with, as Rusalka does. The reason this gets two stars instead of one is that Dvorak's score is magical, and contains everything that I love about his music. Unfortunately this is the only performance available on VHS or DVD. After reading previous reviews, I decided to buy this DVD anyway just because I like Dvorak's music so much, and I wanted to see how he handled operatic music. Don't make the same mistake I did.",Negative
"I bought this because I love Dvorak, and know little or nothing about his operas...I confess I began to watch it without reading the plot synopsis...tried to figure out what was going on without it...I think it's a reasonable expectation that one should be able to understand the plot that way.  So...what's with this girl in the swing, and the pond in the middle of the bedroom floor?  OK...it's a modern interpretation...oh, she's a water nymph, and she's sitting in a tree. It's not that her bedroom has flooded; it's a woodland pond.  Sigh. I hate these modern versions--a fairy tale should be a fairy tale, and in the case of an opera like this, which is not as well known as most, most viewers will (like me) never have seen it before, so why not go with a real tree, a pond, etc.?  This modern nonsense spoils it. Can we expect to see Hansel and Gretel set in the South Bronx? Also, I agree with others...just because it's sung in English (why on earth?) doesn't mean it doesn't need subtitles.  I can only catch about half of the words.  The music is great, and the singing is OK (the prince is too old and too fat to be her love object), but overall it's a disappointment",Negative
"About 15 years ago I had a vhs of an Alice Cooper Show.  It was great.  I was hoping this would be similar.This disappoints on many levels.First off, it is way too dark.  Why create performance art and then not display it by turning off the lights?Second, the video was poor quality to boot.I am guessing but the vhs I had was probably after this era but definitely before Alice Cooper degenerated into generic 80s hair metal.  He had a much more elaborate show with visual tricks such as the head chopping.  Sure after a few rewinds, it was easy to figure out how it was done but it was still visually entertaining and did require some thought to figure out how it was achieved.  Everything was shown in vibrant colors.This show has a whole lot of overly choreographed dancing which really does not help out the raw image of childhood (or childlike) mental illness the Alice character is seeking to portray.About midway during the show there is a group of dancers wearing glow in the dark skeleton graphics and glow in the dark top hats.  If there is a time to make the lighting darker, this would be the time.  But there are lights up in the back so you also see the faces of the dancers.  Why didn't they turn out all the lights?  So the glow in the dark idea was pretty much made null by not doing it properly.  Later, they put a spotlight on Alice Cooper in all white and that makes sense.  But why not exploit the effect up until that point????I know from my previous vhs tape that Alice Cooper can put on an extremely elaborate, VARIED, and interesting, entertaining show.  This one has too much dancing segments that get very repetitive.  They performed the concert in the dark when you really want to see everything nicely lighted, and the video quality was terrible to boot.I wish I knew what the other one was called.  I don't recognize the cover on any Alice Cooper vhs or dvd Amazon is currently offering.  Whatever it was, I hope it becomes available again.As for the extras, the Alice Cooper interview was reasonably interesting.",Negative
"What a disappointment. This was released as a concert movie back in the seventies, and the sound is worse than any theater you could imagine. The film is grainy, and the extras negligible. Rhino should do us a real service and find either a master negative for a reissue, or get the rights to the ABC special that aired right when the album &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot; was released.

The two stars are for Darin's energy during this performance, undeniable and awesome given his physical fragility.I was first exposed to Darin as a kid, during his Tim Hardin and then self-penned ""protest"" period (1966-69).  He dropped the ""-by"" from his stage first name and the rug from his scalp, and seemed quite a revelation.  The only indication that it wasn't an entirely honest transformation was his insistence on calling the harmonica a ""blues harp,"" a term whose fleeting currency had already passed by then. It smacked of a desperation to seem ""hip"" to a younger audience (remember hipness?!).But, in his last years,he went back to his ersatz-Sinatra, showman shtick. It may do him an injustice, but on the evidence of the ""Mack Is Back"" DVD, at heart Darin was always a Las Vegas ham.  Yes, he could manage many genres of music, but he performed most of them with a glitzy lack of sensibility that reminds you of the Chinese water torture that was Sammy Davis Jnr.'s rendering of ""Mr. Bojangles."" And just like Davis (and others whose showbiz upbringing harked back to the fifties), Darin seemed more consumed with a need to demonstrate his showboating versatility -- look, ma, no hands! -- than with the music itself.On ""Mack Is Back,"" Darin's dance moves are exuberant but mostly toe-curling, as are the dirge-like codas he tacks onto many of the songs. His look is out of the Rat Pack Medallion Man handbook.  He sings even his classic hits in the perfunctory, throwaway style of a performer who has been there too many times before. It's easy to understand why Tim Hardin was so upset at being ripped off by him.Oh, and to those who claim Bobby Darin had the greatest voice of all time (see some of the reviews attached to his CD listings): You cannot be serious!",Negative
"I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and ""Midnight Special"" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining.",Negative
"Every Stratford production of Gilbert and Sullivan appeared to be in a race to hit rock bottom with a thud.  They all succeeded.  ""Oh, horror!"" cries the British House of Peers in this comic opera and, for once, with good reason.With the exception of the Maureen Forrester, it is clear that singing was not regarded as a requirement to appear on the stage at Stratford, Ontario.  Fortunately for Forrester, her singing career was glorious enough to survive even this ugly blot.  Barely.Rather than skilled musical performers, the Ontario stage was infested with third-rate clowns who felt free to be ""funny"" whenever and, alas, however possible.Evidently, Stratford's dramaturge, a person who might someday hope to aspire to the higher calling of hack, decided that W. S. Gilbert was incompetent and out of date, so Gilbert's words were improved by the addition of Canadian local references and allusions to long-since forgotten political shenanigans in Ottawa.In the original broadcast, the director carefully explained how he had cut away a century of moldy tradition to return Gilbert and Sullivan to their music hall roots.  If he had uttered such preposterous nonsense to Sullivan, who was a gentlemen, the formally trained and very serious composer would have smiled politely and promptly absented himself from such an obvious fool.  If the director had made that monstrous suggestion to Gilbert, who was not, the fiery and short-tempered dramatist would first have punched the bounder's lights out and then hauled him into court for slander.Pitiful, just purely pitiful.",Negative
"I am writing about the DVD and not necessarily the stage production of the Stratford ""Iolanthe,"" not to be confused with Gilbert & Sullivan's operetta of the same name.In Stratford, Gilbert is insulted; Sullivan in insulted; and the audience is insulted.The producer of the DVD manages to insult the audiences with a laugh track and everything being first recorded in a studio and later lip-synched by the actor during filming.  Extreme-close-ups annoy me - perhaps more than most video watchers.  They remove one from the impressions of a theatrical experience.  The additional story lines involving Strephon `s magic tricks and how they affect production stage hands are simply annoying.  The romance between a stage hand and a cast member adds nothing to the production.  The many changes - additions, deletions, and re-orchestrations  of Sullivan's score insult Sullivan.  The many unnecessary changes in the libretto - even if one reluctantly allows the excuse that topical references used by Gilbert in the original script need to be updated so that the operetta can be appreciated by modern audiences -  show  great disrespect for Gilbert.  There is no cohesiveness between the style of English used, the many Canadian references, the otherwise London references, and the costume design.  Though entertaining and brilliantly performed, the frequent dance routines slow the production story....and they are NOT what Gilbert & Sullivan had in mind.  There is no subtlety in this production.  This everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to entertainment has people behaving in wildly inappropriate ways - and flying through the air before they are fairies.A lot can be said for the enunciation of the singers.  Much more can be understood of Gilbert's clever lyrics (when he is allowed to be present) than usual in video productions.  The director is at fault for getting actors to be silly in their interpretations of characters.  Gilbert would have hated what Stratford has done...and he would have sued.  On the whole, the production - especially the DVD - is a hollow representation of a wonderfully clever and entertaining work by Gilbert & Sullivan.  (I haven't read any other reviews of this DVD.  Sorry if I'm repeating what others said.)",Negative
"This Stratford production, dating from the early 1980's, is one filled with contradictions, both good and bad, refreshing and disturbing.  As many have already detailed the good, the bad, and the ugly, I will add that the fault especially lies with the director, Brian MacDonald, who made some poor choices for though he put together a very lively, well produced show, he definitely missed the marked when it comes to the essence of this great G & S show.  Perhaps most grievously he opted to re-write scenes and dialogue which are as nearly perfect today as they were when Gilbert & Sullivan wrote them in 1880 -- and here in lies the problem.  One does not re-write/edit/re-create great works as masterful as this G & S operetta!  Changing some dialogue or adding or updating a verse of lyrics is occassionally acceptable but transforming a work like this is an artisitc offense. (One wonders just where were the Board of Directors?) Many unsuspecting folks will watch this well financed, overly directed production and find it charming, fun, silly and entertaining.  However they will not be seeing or hearing what G & S intended.  Being well acquainted with all of the G & S operetta's I would not recommend this production as it lacks the finest singing (so strange as Stratford usually hits it out of the theatre with fine singers!) -- and it especially betrays the wonderful characters and Victorian sentimentality and fun of the original with over (or under) acting, goofy silliness, and constant, distracting, never ending, flamboyant choreography that one's money would be better spent elsewhere, perhap on the Stratford's other filmed productions such as the charming IOLANTHE or their brilliant MIKADO. - JPD/Grand Junction, CO",Negative
Not hte best product-sound and visulas are all over the place. Did not meet my expectations at all.If you really want a great DVD of Tina-the Tina Turner one last time live in concert is the best.This DVD makes you feel like you are at the concert-great sound and the visuals are GREAT! This is Tina at her finest....,Negative
"Great songs, but a waste for DVD technology. The sound is poor, I can't believe it's in 5.1. Not to mention that video quality hasn't met my expectations. Couldn't believe that this was Mr Diamond's best show. If you like him, better buy the Cd (I bet it will sound better). Conclusion: Look for a DVD that takes advantage of technology",Negative
"Unfortunately there is not a lot of Neil Diamond available on video. Greatest Hits Live is rather hit and miss. Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing.",Negative
"Don't waste your money on this one.very bad sound track and a very very cheesy performance.this is absolutely NOT Neil Diamond in his greatest form..very bad, overall filmed and cut.sorry Neil..",Negative
I actually like the material on this DVD -- BUT it does not work on a computer.  It has some kind of copy protection.  Then it would not eject from my mac mini.,Negative
"I will keep this review short &amp; sweet!! The content of this DVD is AWESOME (music &amp; videos), while the DVD itself sucks!! I hate DVDs that are mono-layered!! In other words, you have to turn the DVD to see another half of material!! Why everything wasn't on a single sided DVD is beyond me because it isn't impossible with only 106 minutes of content!! Get this used or extremely cheap on Ebay!!!",Negative
"After DIO Sabbath with ozzy singing is crap, he can't do it anymore.  To think this was uspposed to be his final show and it wasen't that great.  Zack Wylde ruins all the classics with his ""ehhhh"" twang instead of playing the damn songs.  I hate his playing.  Over all not worth the price.",Negative
"1. A sell out, clear and simple.  Supporting Slipknot, Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit ect. as metal, need I say more?  This is the only reason why he gets to play at big arenas, stay on the radio, as well as MTV, because he betrayed the metal scene.  Clear and simple.  Maiden, Megadeth, Iced Earth, Type O' Negative and Dio havent betrayed it, so thats why their fame isnt as popular now days or never will be, because they hate this false metal, and will not support it whatsoever.  Just read the interviews by these bands for yourself.  Alot of people say if Ozzy didnt support this nu metal, then he wouldnt make any money, please!! The non sell out bands I just listed arent as popular, yet they make bundles of money, sold out world shows everytime.  So there are plenty of true metalheads out there that know whats going on, and still stick with the real metal bands.2.  Ozzy's vocals are off key.  Just listen to Mr. Crowley, No more tears, Mama im coming home or Bark at the moon, the list goes on.  Not saying you cant like his voice, I do admit it is unique, but not mature at all.  Also alot of people say he is a genius.  A man who bit heads off bats and pigeons, someone who moons people on stage, as well as not knowing any other word except the F word.  Thats a legend? I think not.  Wake up Ozzy lovers and realize a true musician doesnt do those kinds of things, especially not a legend.  Thats also one reason why he gets so much attention, a bit immature wouldnt you say?3.  Now, Ozzy however has great music, and has worked with some fascinationg guitarists, bassists and Drummers, but this great music with his vocals that do not fit, just doesnt cut it.  I admit Ozzy is a pretty good songwriter when it comes to lyrics, however only his musicians right the music. It should be obvious he knows nothing about writing music or keys, offkey vocals, cant play any instrument, almost ready to fall over on stage. Even when he was with the legendary sabbath, the man who started it all? Please, Dio has been doing music before Ozzy was even born.  I admit Tony and Geezer along with Bill rocked, Ozzy was just an old school mate who sung badly with them, but they liked it.  So the Sabbath players are maybe what started it, but not ozzy, he was just lucky to be able to sing with them.  So this review will be hated and everything, but at least I have proof about this, yet im respecting his music minus vocals, thats why it gets 2 stars.  Ozzy lovers at least know this man is immature as well as incredible silly, yet worked with great musicians.  Thats all.",Negative
"Until a DVD is released with footage from the Randy Rhodes era I could care less about ANYTHING else that's released on OZZY. There may be a good song here and there (& not to bash Zack, Jake E. & whoever else) but to me Ozzy without Randy is irrelevant. This, of course, excludes Sabbath. I have a VHS of the ""After Hours show"", excellent video but only mono sound, so I would LOVE a professional 5.1 or 6.1 release of it. I also have several bootleg concert VHSs and in at least one of them (Japan - Budokan I think) professional cameras can be seen. So the footage is out there.Ozzy...what's the problem??",Negative
"The sound quality of this DVD is not good, and the video quality is not clear, either. Apparently it was transfer from analog system and the engineer who did the job didn't do anything to improve the quality of this  DVD.",Negative
"This supposed concert video is nothing but a collection of nonsense pre-concert, backstage, and audience garbage video. It shows 2 second clips of actual ""live"" band footage intermixxed with camera shots bouncing all over the place. A real concert video is just that, a live video of a band on stage playing their songs. Thank GOD I bought a cheap VHS version. I never even watched the whole thing. If you want to see a real show check out Iron Maiden's Rock In Rio or Primal Fear's The History Of Fear. This crap wouldn't be worth watching if it was sent to you for free!!!! I can't imagine Ozzy ever saw this and approved its release.",Negative
"I LOVE Ozzy Osbourne.He is awesome live.He has one of the best stage presences in metal.But this DVD is not a real concert.What this is the music from the Live and Loud CD played in the background played over a bunch of crappy video footage.Half of it doesn't even belong here.The music is great,but the video footage is what messes this up.If you want a real Ozzy concert,buy &quot;Live At Budokan&quot;.If you want to get the REAL concert this was taken from,buy the CD.Also,The DVD does NOT have instant chapter access like the case says so.Plus,the DVD is two sided.This means that you have to flip it over in the middle of the concert.",Negative
"Ozzy Osbourne didn't even make most of the music or even write his lyrics.  This concert video portrays Ozzy at his dumbest.  Ozzy is the real life Homer Simpson, but annoying instead of funny.  Ozzy's voice is shrill, flat, off key and bad.  The only reason it doesn't sound too ear bursting on the video is because Sharon insisted that Ozzy re-record and do voice overs in the studio.I agree with the other guy who stated that Ozzy is not to be given the credit for starting metal.  Ronnie James Dio was playing in bands, recording, and in the music industry way before Ozzy was.  Ronnie James Dio is an actual composer and musician.  Not a low life drug addict slacker that relys on everyone else to do his work, aka: Ozzy.  Dio still packs houses around the world so don't get the idea that Ozzy is the only popular metal singer left.Zack Wyld is a good guitarist but he is no where near as great as Randy Rhodes or Jake E lee.  This video portrays Zack flaunting his long girly hair and hamming up the concert.If you want to see Ozzy running around like a lost toddler with poop in its diaper.  Go ahead and buy the concert.  If not then don't waste your money on this ....",Negative
"This is another Sharon Osborne rip-off . Just a way to manipulate the fans.....This is a live cd that they took a bunch of random video clips and put to the music. They aren't really playing what you are hearing. It does not even match . It would be like you took a soundtrack from a movie and just took random clips of those actors from wherever and tried to make them fit the sound and then released this as a movie. No one would go see this or buy it . Why would you buy it ? If you want Ozzy live , buy the Live at Budokan . It is great.If you are thinking of buying the Blizzard of Oz cd , Sharon and Ozzy decided to be greedy again and cut out the band members other than Randy and re-record the parts in order to not have to pay these guys who made Ozzy famous again . These 2 are super greedy. I went to Ozzfest a few years ago to see Iron Maiden and their stupid daughter Kelly Osborne and her friends had been throwing stuff at Iron Maiden while they played due to the fact that people said Maiden was better than Ozzy on that tour. Maiden left the tour and I did not get to see them. This dvd is typical Sharon Osborne greed .",Negative
"There are many Celine Dion songs that I like.  When I borrowed this DVD from my mother, I watched eagerly as she sang many of these favourites including &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; and &quot;Think Twice&quot;.  Straight away I thought how fantastic her voice was, and couldn't believe that her performances sounded just like the recorded versions.  Something puzzled me when I read the tracklist on the back cover and only one song had &quot;Live&quot; written after it (&quot;When I Fall in Love&quot;). I figured that it must be a typo since the whole DVD was a live concert.  Well, apparently not!  This pseudo concert is nothing more that Celine lip-syncing - quite shameful when you think about it.  The only live song being the one just noted.If her voice is really as good as people claim, then why does she need to lip-synch?  Why even bother putting on the show?  We may as well all just listen to her CD's at home!  I now wonder if her voice is manipulated in the studio to make it sound so good on record.Overall, a very disappointing DVD.  Not a real concert at all/",Negative
"If you are a fan of Celine Dion, you will easily realize most songs she sang here are exactly the same as original CD version. Disappointedly, that means they were lipsynced or dubbed. Moreover, this shows some edited  scenes regardless of music. So seeing this video like a can is not very  exiting. And I don't like the third-rate dancers.",Negative
"not bad in terms of seeing the bad boys of boston behind the scenes in the studio but bad in terms of dvd entertainment - no special features, no menu, there isn't even any artwork on the disc.I think I speak on behalf of most Aerosmith fans when I say that the record company needs to release an Aerosmith concert on DVD for us. They must be the only band in the world that don't have a live concert to buy whenever you walk into a virgin megastore or a wallmart! It's frustrating! They should have even released an &quot;OH YEAH! GREATEST VIDEO HITS&quot; to coincide with the CD &amp; the dvd could have had special features to make up for the songs without videos - for example big ten inch live, dream on live, etc. Surely this would have been more exciting to us fans than this!!No wonder Aerosmith don't get the recognition they deserve if you cant even buy a concert or video compilation on DVD.",Negative
"why are you praising this guy so much? he was just playing the blues! anyone can do that now-a-days! i thought the dvd was boring and was another blues artist. big freakin' deal!you want some real guitar master, search for steve vai, joe satriani, yngwie malmsteen, john petrucci, tony mcalpine, etc... these are the true guitar gods!lets be real here, the dvd was crap. don't waste your money on it.",Negative
"This product is an example of how sometimes the progression of technology results in the regression of value. I believe this DVD version of this concert is nothing but the made-for-TV version that had to be under an hour, hence the absence of much of the material featured on the original VHS version.I highly recommend that you find the VHS version--there are some to be had for reasonable prices. The VHS version is 30 minutes longer in concert length and has no edits or interview interruptions. On the VHS version, the sound is a little bit distorted (common for VHS tapes), but overall is good.As for the performance, overall great, but there a few shaky moments. When the drummers finish their solos in Elizabeth Reed and everybody comes back in for the main theme reprisal, it's a rhythmic MESS for a few seconds while the drummers have to drag the tempo back down to what the guitarists are playing--lol. The guitars are a bit out-of-tune in a couple of places on that number as well, but Warren and/or Dickie are pretty quick to tune it back up on the fly...The BEST tune on this concert recording (and thankfully is preserved intact on the DVD version) is Going Down The Road Feeling Bad. I can't tell you how GREAT it is! Just a simple country-blues tune, but Dickie and Warren just absolutely shine on it, vocally and instrumentally! That track is worth the price of the whole concert!So if you can't find the VHS version of this (or can't use it), then I still recommend getting the DVD version for what it is--a lot better than no version at all!",Negative
"The first place I saw footage of this concert was on youtube and let me tell you I was blown away. The allman brothers band perform there best songs. So when I heard there was an official dvd release I was beside myself with excitment, That is until I read the reviews stating that this dvd only shows short segments of these performances intertwined with interviews and all I could think was WHY! why would the people in charge of releasing this do something so completely idiotic. This is a complete tragedy to think that this concert exsist in full on vhs but only in bits and peices on dvd. I can only hope that one day this company will have the common sense to release this in full as it was originally intended.",Negative
"I used to have this on VHS and was ecstatic when the DVD came out.  Although the VHS was itself not the entire show at Great Woods (which is what we really want), nonetheless, what we got was terrific.  But it's just a travesty what happened on the way to the DVD editing room.  It's all chopped up with interviews interrupting the solos, truncated and/or missing songs.  It's so irritating that I will never view it again.  Now, if this show (with Warren, Allen, Dickey, Greg, Marc, Butch and Jaimoe) were re-released without the horrible edits it would be a ""must have"".Until then - avoid it.",Negative
I cannot believe that Sony completely wrecked the DVD version of this spectacular show. Buy the VHS version and pray that they re-release this properly someday. :(,Negative
"Like a lot of reviewers here, I bought the VHS edition when it first came out...nothing but the highest praise for that version.  There is perhaps no better single video that so superbly documents what these guys do onstage  ( at least not with Dickey Betts in the lineup ).  I was fortunate enought to have stumbled upon the DVD for rent first...which I did, and that was it, for reasons stated so well by everybody else here.  By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!",Negative

"I've been a fan of Gloria Estefan for years and have purchased and enjoyed many of her audio CDs.  This is the first DVD I have purchased and it is truly disappointing.  The music was wonderful, but the productions were terrible.  To me it took on the look of one big strobe light!  There were so many flashing lights in the backgrounds, foregrounds, above, below, from helicopters that most of the images were washed out and appeared overexposed and ghost-like.  Certainly not flattering to someone as attractive as Gloria.  Too bad, but this one is going to be discarded.  If you're over the age of 15 and appreciate good entertainment, then you're wasting your time with this DVD.",Negative

I have reviewed 5 Beethoven DVDs. Yes the recording is old....but can't imagine why video is so poor. The real problem is we buy these great masterpieces to experience the orchestra and not the conductor. We don't buy operas to watch the conductor nearly full time. I would agree there is little cinematography going on here....which seems criminal with such an important piece. I am nervous to get any Karajan piano or violin concertos les they not focus on the performer. I have a solution in Beethoven's masterpiece. Get the recent Blu-ray Vienna performance with Thielmann conducting in glorious 1080p DTS high definition. You will always judge every classical DVD by this performance....especially the direction and cinematography and of course picture and sound quality.,Negative
"Mariah Carey - Around the World is not even a full-length concert, some of the songs are not completed and the intimate conversations with her friends are boring. Mariah even lip-synch's on some of the tracks and her dancing is not great. The only performance I liked was her duet with Trey Lorenz on I'll Be There. This is Mariah's worst concert DVD ever! Don't buy it because it is just segments of live performances, a disappointment.",Negative
"The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it's cut, I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song.  It gets really annoying...but it does have the videos of &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;The Roof&quot; 2 of Mariah's best videos.",Negative
"I really liked her earlier video &quot;(Here is) Mariah Carey&quot;. So I bought this DVD with huge expectation. But...(sigh) this one is simply disappointing. Mariah was changed in some ways especially in appearance, I  think. In most concerts here she seemed she tried to make them underwear  fashion shows and she danced like a third-rate stripper. I was watching  this DVD with my parents and totally embarrassed by her sultry look and  suggestive dances. She is so mean now. (Mariah, wake up and look around  yourself!) And I don't understand why the title is &quot;Around the  World&quot;. Are there only four countries in the world? I don't think so.  One more BIG problem with this video is many songs including &quot;My  All&quot; and &quot;I'll Be There&quot; were edited inappropriately to make  them very short(running around just 1 to 2.5 minutes). In particular,  &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot; with Olivia Newton-John was cut so  awkwardly(even make me laugh). I really don't understand this kind of  reckless editing. Consequently, you'd better think over and check carefully  about buying this DVD.",Negative

This film is an agony to watch for any true music lover. Also, one last word folks (and this is true for Altamont too), don't judge the motives of the entire love and peace generation by the results of an incompetently organized rock event. As Seth and Amy would say, ""Really!""",Negative
"If youre getting this for ELP or the doors then youre gonna be disappointed. They cut them out of the movie. The doors first song on the movie is ""When the musics over,"" its cut about 2 minutes into the performance. The other performance, ""The End"" is in its entirety. ELP's performance, (which is the highlight of the festival and the movie) is about 2 minutes long. You get to see them right when they start and then it cuts away to the end of their performance. So if youre wanting this movie to see ELP's historic ""debut"" performance then forget it, youre gonna have to wait for it to come out later. If it ever does. The rest of the performances are pretty much ... The Who is terrible and you get to really see which bands were for real and which ones weren't. The best bands are cut out and the worst are all over the place. So, its your call. As far as the rest of it, its mostly some guy whining, (concert promoter) about why he's losing money, and some good scenes of hippies. So if you dont care about the music so much and want to see hippies and freaks as they really were, then its worth a look, otherwise forget it.",Negative
"This 2 disc version of ""Closure"" that is on sale here, is a bootleg version of the official VHS version that was released back in 1997, whilst it might look like the real thing just Google Nine Inch Nails ""Closure"" and you will see that although it was intended for release on DVD it never came about.Trent Reznor uploaded the original version(with extras) and a whole 2nd disc on to a bit torrent site back in December 2006 so somebody here has now knocked up their own version and making a profit off it.

Placing Type O Negative over the soundtrack to a 1930's black and white silent film is like trying to watch ""Dawn of the Dead"" overdubbed with ""The Monster Mash"".  Utterly awful. These bogus made-up ""Goths"" have spoiled the vampire mystique for everyone. Even if i liked this sorry-ass band (which i don't),i'd still think this was a horrible, LAME idea.",Negative
"I wish this was just pure music and didn't have the chanting over it. While I chant these things myself, I do not buy a cd to hear someone chanting, I can do that myself. The music is so beautiful, why ruin it by interrupting it with chanting?Hopefully one of his other albums does not have this chanting or any other spoken words over it.",Negative
"Lou Reed is not Brian Eno. This is even less interesting than ""Metal Machine Music."" Lou should retire to avoid embarrassing himself further. I've heard more interesting air conditioners.",Negative
"I have to agree with wilco lover's review. This is more of Lou Reed making music for Lou Reed. And while there are artists who can accomplish that feat and can still remain interesting to the listener. Lou has not been able to climb that mountain for quite some time. What he now finds enjoyable or worthy for himself, fails on many levels to the outside ear. One of the most important of which is immediacy. The urgency in Lou Reed's music, for the most part, disappeared when he decided to control his own production. The Arista years was the beginning of that transformation. Apparently he felt much better about the change in his career. And financially, he may have succeeded with no small contribution from a few important others. But artistically, his music suffered. While there are a few exceptions, Street Hassle being a primary one, Lou Reed indeed became fairly irrelevant. His music became lifeless. No immediacy, no compelling descriptions of the street or of any suffering, or of life's challenges.One of the other exceptions besides Street Hassle to that is ""Animal Serenade"". Very interesting and artistic takes of some older songs as well as newer ones. The introduction to ""Smalltown"" is alone worth the purchase price all by itself. And ""How do you think it Feels"" is a very memorable rendition. Surprising in a way and sounding very current.This latest thing is hardly surprising at all. And along with recent efforts: The ""Ectasy"" album (future farmers, modern dance ugh) and ""The Raven"" are quite honestly just embarrassing. ""Set the Twilight Reeling"" succeeds for about 1 or 2 songs.By no means am I the kind of fan who has to relive all the artists previous work nor do I automatically deplore anything that doesn't closely resemble past triumphs. But at the same time, there has to be good song writing, solid melody and hooks, interesting lyrics, innovative song structures. Something to get your arms around, to feel like he really cares about what he's playing or singing. Some emoting or energy should be present to capture the listener. For sure it doesn't always have to be an indie or glam or hard rock sound to succeed. It can be contemplative and alluring, but it should be so in a memorable or compelling fashion. Most of his post NYC albums lack those once common yet now quite rare important elements.Lou once remarked that ""editing"" was one of the most important aspects of song writing. That's what appears to be Lou's problem now and has been for some time now. He's got no one editing his work. No producer or collaborator to help him toss the fluff and the weak stuff out or to save and rework later into better tracks. Five minutes of this may have worked as soundtrack material for something much more inspiring or interesting. By itself, or as music to meditate to, it's immediately forgettable. Despite all the amputations, this is still not very good.If you must buy this meditation album because it's a Lou Reed record then buy it used for a cheap price, and believe me it will quickly become very very cheap. Or better yet, go to the library and check it out for free. That's where you'll find dozens of other forgettable meditation albums. I'd say download it from the web, except I'm not sure it's really worth taking up hard drive space for.1 and a half stars on effort and an attempt at producing something outside the norm. But ultimately and very sadly, failing miserably in the effort.",Negative
"I'm a big Blondie fan, and was anxiously looking forward to this. I listened to some sound samples and felt that was more than sufficient, so I slapped down the cash and bought this deluxe fan pack. Actually, I went one step further and purchased the edition with the bonus booklet, available exclusively from another vendor.'Panic of Girls' starts off strong enough with a classic aggressive New Wave song titled D Day, complete with the (thankfully) back in vogue analog synthesizers. What a great opening track! Follow that with the strong and catchy hook of What I Heard, and one may think this will be a stellar album. That is furthered with the excellent first single, Mother. It has a Maria-esque hook and is an instant classic.Unfortunately, the album falls apart after that. Without getting into the disappointment of each subsequent track, I will just state there is way too much Reggae rhythm and mid-tempo snoring going on. Blondie has always been very diverse on each album, though this one lacks that diversity and stays the way of dull World music. After such a great opening few songs, the only other track maybe worth a listen is Love Doesn't Frighten Me, though it lacks a real hook and the chorus and is a bit repetitious. Some people slammed the last album, 'The Curse of Blondie', though I find that album infinitely more satisfying than this.Due to delays in getting this substandard album released, Blondie has stated they are already well underway with their next album. I will definitely listen to the sound samples much more closely before purchasing, but also feel the missing Jimmy Destri, who wrote a number of great Blondie classics, may be an added reason for this lackluster installment. I think Chris Stein may need to do a bit of a roots check.",Negative
I've been a fan of this band since the 80's and this is by far my least favorite of their work.I liked 2 songs on this as nothing else was really that strong for me.01 D-Day02 What I Heard,Negative
"Joe Satriani is capable of much more.  I think this album along with the first one proves that Joe just can't write actual rock songs (outside of his solo stuff) that are more than just mediocre.  Everything is just so bland and average.  I wish he would go back to doing Surfing with the Alien type music.  He was so great and inspired back then.  Anyway, I know people here don't like the comparison, but the new Van Halen Album ""A Different Kind of Truth"" absolutely destroys this waste of time.  I hope CF changes things a lot for their next album.  I will keep buying them, but I'm starting to lose faith that they will come out with anything decent in their current form.  I do think, however, the drummer is really good, and that shows on this album.",Negative
One or two decent songs but over all mostly filler tracks and cheesey as hell lyrics.  The first album was better and even that one lacked good material.  New Van Halen is way better.,Negative
Sammy- You Are One Loose Bird- To Think That This Rocks And It's The Best Band You Ever played In -As You Said- I'm Not Buying What Your Selling My Friend- It Just Doesn't Sound Together Or Humble- And The Words Blow Too!,Negative
No words to desribe this atrocity (boring) of music! Please see my review for the first Chickenfoot because this one is basically the same.,Negative
"Unfotunately this CD is very disappointing. It comes across as an effort to put out product and make some money by some very talented musicians who have nothing to say. It is well recorded and produced but the tunes are boring and the lyrics are meanignless and shallow. It really comes across as a recording by some rich, lazy, fat musicians who have lots of guitars, free time and money.",Negative
"Or should I say more like Chicken Kiev... full of fillers! Anyway, If you ever had the pleasure of smelling a chicken coop on a hot and humid day.... this is what you're kinda getting here. So lets hold our noses and rip through Chickenfoot III track by track.Note to Chickenfoot: Drop the hippie-dippie peace sign logo..... It just ain't happening anymore!!1. Last Temptation: The opening of this song sounded like something Stone Temple Pilots would have done back in the 90`s. I did manage to get through this mediocre rock song. Won't be returning to it.2. Alright Alright: ( Hit The Skip Button) &lt;yawn>3. Different Devil: (Hit The Skip Button) Sounds like Rick Springfield penned this one.4. Up Next: This mid-tempo rocker has Sammy thinking he's going upstairs instead of downstairs shoveling coal. Not a bad song.5. Lighten Up: The opening distorted organ reminds me of Deep Purple in a way. Another mid-tempo rocker. Nothing special here other than Satriani's lead.... Hit the skip button.6. Come Closer: (Hit The Skip Button Fast!) C'mon guys really?? This sounds like a really lame mid 1980's ballad. Hey Michael Anthony... Runnin With The Devil, On Fire, Atomic Punk....what happened brother?7. Three And Half Letters: This is a cool song with good message about hardships in a bad economy....Can't tell if Sammy is going hoarse on this one or it's an effect. This still doesn't make up for track 6!8. Big Foot: Ok, Now we're talking! Snappy little riff drives this one home. Great rocking song and I enjoyed the Zeppelin reference. We'll be returning to this one for sure.9. Dubai Blues: Another mediocre rocker.... Won't be returning to it.10. Something Going Wrong: I'm feeling a little Luke 21:6-28 on this one. This song has a back in the bayou feel to it. (Finger is gently rubbing the skip button)11. No Change (Hidden Track): They're doing a whole lotta lying and I'm not sure who they are. On this one it sounds like they were trying for an early Van Halen feel with Joe's guitar panned hard left and echoing right. This should have opened the record.With all the religious overtones on this album it does seem like Sammy or someone in the band is searching. In my opinion that's a good thing.I do give this album a four star rating for mix & mastering production, It's not overly compressed with virtually no digital clipping & distortion. Once in awhile you'll hear some hard limiting. Great Job on sound.Compared to their now rivals Van Halen and with all the trash talking from Sammy last year. I now listened to both albums and I must say Van Halen's A Different Kind Of Truth smokes this album tenfold. I feel Chickenfoot III won't stand the test of time and by next year you'll see it in the bargain bin.Hopefully Chickenfoot II will be better.",Negative
"Liked Sammy's work with Van Halen and selectively his solo stuff. Love most everything Satriani has put out. Feel indifferent about the other two band members. Liked 3-4 tracks off the first Chickenfoot album to keep me interested and they still make it into my workout set list every once in a while.... My kid gloves off review of this album is not too kind. I don't hear growth so much as regression. The best two tracks on the album are Different Devil and Up Next, everything else is throw away. Different Devil is good but it sounds like something off a Hagar solo record, Up Next is the only song that reminds me the guitarist behind this album is one of the best alive. Only problem with Up Next is that I really don't want to hear Hagar's vocals on this one because the lyrics just disappoint compared to that great guitar work.Oh well, maybe the next one will be better.",Negative
"I'm a big fan of Satriani and Hagar. I was so excited when the first Chickenfoot was about to come out, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment. And this album is no different. It's like all the talents don't merge very well. All the songs sound like demos. I'd recommend to listen to it via youtube or other source before buying it.",Negative
"The first CD was a big surprise, it was awesome and catchy and footstompin! It really had a flavor to it, all the songs packed a helluva punch with terrific hooks, great beats, and awesome guitar work from Joe Satriani.  It's just a fun hard rock album all the way! The new CD is hard, dreary, flat, generic, boring, terrible ballads, poorly written music and bad production! There isnt much catch about any of these songs, I mean nothing!  It just seems it getting so much harder for bands to write great music and produce great albums!  It's mostly miss even for classic bands!  There isnt really a single song I like on this entire album, it's no stars for me!  As much fun as the guys were having, they should of taken their time, and come back to the studio another time instead of writing all the songs, recording, and releasing this right away!  They weren't ready for another album yet.  This is a throwaway and it will fall off the chart after a few weeks!  It's like a very bad 80's hard rock album.  There were plenty of them, Sammy made a few bad solo albums like this.  This is a dud, sorry!",Negative
"Yes Indeed! I agree Sammy... Something has gone terribly wrong here!!!If you actually listen to this ""overly-cheesy-sandwich"" you'll understand why.I suggest you do yourself a huge favor and pass on this pile of steaming dung unless a toilet is really handy.",Negative
"I'm a total Satch fan, but this release sounded overall phoned in. The singing/screaming n' yelling just overdone and out of place too often.. maybe the next one will be better.. The first release had at least a good handful of tunes that were superstar slamming..",Negative
"I agree with quite a few others that almost all the songs here are generic sounding Sammy Hagar songs (maybe something solo).  Not even the great guitar player can save these songs.  The only song I like is the last one, Something Gone Wrong!  And that describes the rest of this CD for me.  I was really surprised by the first Chickenfoot CD, the songs were really catchy GREAT HOOKS that had you stompin your foot!  And I'm not even the biggest Hagar fan, I did like Montrose and selective Van Hagar!  But that first CD really nailed it and it was a surprise hit going GOLD!  I just dont see the same thing happening here, I dont think it's going to catch on like the first one!",Negative
"Post G N'R fame/appreciation is very ironic to me. When I grew up, G N' R was a nice blend of Hanoi Rocks, George Thorogood(I'm serious), and Punk influences. One of the many things that set them apart were their solos, which weren't overly indulgent like Poison, Bon Jovi or the other egotistical ""Guitar Heroes"" that dominated mainstream media. Now, years later Slash is hailed as a Guitar Hero and is splashed all over magazine covers, Guitar Center ads, and television. His current status with all the signature gear is eerily similar to the aforementioned detested bands.Sig. gear?! You can buy an old school JCM800 amp for a fraction of the cost. Or track down the rare Jubilee heads. The Duncan JB pickups in that over-hyped AFD guitar can be had for $160; throw them in an LP Standard and there ya go! same thing. Schooled players know that Appetite was recorded with a one-off custom made LP COPY. Stuff it, Gibson. ;)What makes this record bad? Current live performances feature 5 minute guitar solos! Very self-indulgent. This group feels like some hired guns covering some G N' R tracks! Sure, Slash can still play but these riffs seem very Metal and self-indulgent. I like that he's in a group without drama and tip my hat to his success, but Myles Kennedy doesn't seem to compliment him well. G N' R was successful because as a unit, they worked well. Apart, the results are so varied. Duff has remained down to earth, but a front man? His vocals aren't up to par. Same with this LP. The music, here and there has some highlights, but seems so disjointed as whole.How many fans like this independently of Guns? Does this record stand up on its own minus Slash's previous band? These are honest questions to ask.Have fun being post Guns lap dogs.",Negative
"What I'd like to know is what the guys in the band were saying to each other when they were going over the final mix-down. It couldn't have been ""Check out that guitar solo!"" or ""This song is incredible!"" or ""Guys, we really outdid ourselves this time! Great work, everybody!""This was simply one of the worst compilations of ""rock"" music I have ever heard. The riffs are boring! The lyrics are boring! The music is boring! This album is garbage. There isn't one single memorable hook or lyric on it. It was a total and complete waste of money!They should have named the album ""Apocalyptic Sleeping Pill.""Clank! Clank! Clank! (That was the sound of the CD smacking the sides of the trash can).",Negative
"I bought this cd expecting a whole lot from slash.After listening to it a couple of times iwas pretty depressed nothing extraordinary just plain, not one song stuck out. may hesitate to buy his next cd",Negative
"This album sucks. The singer sounds horrible, and the songs all sound like the same generic rock. Slash's last album was much better.",Negative
"Sorry but a singer generally makes a group, and this guy sounds the same on every song, making all the songs sound the same -- I wish Slash could team up with Ozzy - that could be interesting; I'll pass on this mess.",Negative
"The vocals are the weakest link in this chain of overproduced mush.  It's so polished it just slides in one ear and out the other.  Not one song stands out; not one memorable riff, hook or chorus.  Geddy Lee sounds tired and worn out with nothing interesting to sing about.On the plus side, I do like getting the digital booklet with the MP3 download.  I think that should be standard with all MP3 album purchases.",Negative
"Long-time Rush fan here (30+ years), beginning with the first album and continuing on.  Regrettably, I have to say this release is GOD AWFUL.  It just goes from bad to worse.  For the life of me I cannot understand all of these high reviews.  For me, I find the songwriting to be extremely poor, not a memorable tune here.  The guitar work is unimaginative and very average.  I didn't dig Geddy's singing either -- he seems unable to write and deliver a good hook or melody.  The quality of the recording stinks too.  By today's standards (and those of yesteryear) this release is a complete an utter loser.Sorry guys, but this is THE WORST CD I have heard in years.  I want my money back!!!!!",Negative
"Forget about wishing them well. Another jumbled mess. Geddy, quit singing so high. You're voice doesn't sound good high anymore. Yet, a few good songs on the album...'The Garden' and 'The Wreckers"" are keepers. The rest, throw aways. Tis a shame cuz there are some good parts in practically every song. But, now, now! Taken as a whole....that's another story. That's where the word 'lame' comes to mind. Take the beginning of 'Carnies' for instance. I swear if that doesn't sound like a sixty nine dollar Zoom pedal from Musician's Friend, I don't know what does. Yet, the chorus on that song isn't half bad. Very begining of 'Seven Cities of Gold'...not bad...the rest of it..barf city. And that hyped up title track, 'Clockwork Angels' dissapointed me the most. Can't stand it when bands include old crap (Caravan, BU2B) on new albums. Geddy, you really should listen to a few Billy Joel albums before you go about writing the next album. You know, just to keep you from straying too far from what a melodic song should sound like. Or even better, pull out some of your OWN albums. Anything before 'Presto' would do fine. I'm gonna say it again. Fire that producer. He isn't helping at all. I recently listened to Slash's new album and thought it was produced very well even though I didn't care for the music all that much. You should see about getting that person to produce your next album if Terry Brown is not available. In summary, a couple of new Rush songs to add to my collection, but once again I get that feeling of dread that Rush has come and gone with another crappy album.",Negative
"While technically stunning in concept and execution, the music is surprisingly empty - none of it reached me.  Surprising, as that's a rare occurance for Rush.  There just isn't anything that remained in my mind (or soul) after a couple listens.  Disappointing.",Negative
"I'm another long-time Rush fan who found Clockwork Angels to be completely disappointing.  I think the production of this CD left Geddy's vocals sounding completely flat and distant, like he's on a hill 100 feet away from the rest of the band while recording is going on, and without his dynamic voice giving life to the lyrics, and everything else being mashed together, to me it's just one continuous boring bit of overly loud overly processed noise.  If you want to hear the real Rush, buy anything else they've released but this.",Negative
"I'm not going to comment on the songs. They are all great, the executions are all great. But my Goodness, the sound.... it is beyond bad. I'm a drummer, recording engineer and audiophile. Dear RUSH, one piece of advice: Let go the computer. Make a commitment to NOT use any more plug-ins just for the sake of it. Where is Mr. Paul Northfield? He is the one who knows how to record and mix RUSH. I bought the CD, didn't ""download"" compressed crap, thinking it would sound as good as the RUSH CDs from the 90's and before. Sadness indeed. Didn't happen. Go re-record this album using a 2 inch analog tape machine, go Neve or SSL consoles... transfer it to the computer if you want, but for crying out loud, let Mr. Northfield do his magic. PLEASE.UPDATE: I have been listening to this album a lot, and again... I can't accept the sound quality. Over use and abuse of compressors during mixing. I BET this album has been entirely mixed using in-ear reference monitors, on tired ears. The problem with this approach is that the unexperienced mixing engineer will undoubtedly abuse EQ as well. Excess low end, and excess of high end frequencies. This album sounds dull, insanely over compressed, no dynamics. This is, without a doubt, the worst RUSH album of their career, in regards to sound quality. They need to get the original flat recordings and give them to someone that knows how to mix and master.UPDATE 2: OMFG you can actually hear the compression on Neil's drum kit overhead microphones! Go to track 11 ""Wish them well"" and cue to around 2:25 and you can hear the woooosh of the compressor getting out of the way on his crash cymbals. SHAMEFUL! The cymbal attack is compressed and its shimmer isn't. How Neil, Geddy and Alex approved this for release is beyond my comprehension. Really, all I can say to them is I ""Wish them well""...!",Negative
"I remember while most teenagers in the mid to late 90's were listening to pop, rap, country, or crappy alternative stuff that was apssing for rock, I was listening to bands teens 10 and 20 years prior were listening to, Scorpions, Motley Crue, Led Zeppelin, Rush, ACDC to name just a few, but all bands you know and many you could probably guess.  Rush happened to be one of my favorites out of the lot.  My picks for best and worst albums would differ greatly from typical Rush fans, but regardless of album I could at least find enjoyment in half the album, if not the whole thing.  This caused some troubles with some of the 70's stuff which only had 4 or 6 songs, but hey.  2112 is an amazing album.Unfortunately this album just didn't grab me.  For starters the production was a little too muddy, though I could overlook that with better songs.  And that's where this album really falls flat.  The song writing is just ok at best.  There's nothing to capture one's attention with most of them.  They aren't really bad or anything, they're just there.  You have Caravan which started the album off to a decent note, but that being the first single, had I known, would have worried me as it's only a decent song. Halo Effect is by far my favorite song on here.  I love the acoustic guitars, and the rest of the band puts in a solid effort, beautiful song.  Garden had nice acoustic guitars as well, but I think I was hoping for more reading how much others like this song.  It's still decent though.The album feels like a bunch of ideas they decided must go into the album without thought to how they'd work together.  One song has this random bluesy acoustic guitar piece which sounds really cool and all, but really doesn't fit the song and just comes from out of nowhere, though probably the best part of that song.  The vocal melodies are flat out boring and uninspiring.  The guitar riffs, mostly are the same, though there are a few stand out riffs to be found.  Headlong Flight has a great riff and awesome verses, setting up to be a great fast paced rocker, however the chorus which isn't that great completely changes the pace, and not in a way that works.  The song gets ridiculously slow.  I get songs can change pace and like many songs which do this, but this particular song it didn't work.  Bu2b or whatever had the same problem.  The verses were kind of groove rock and the chorus got all fast, in a way that didn't work for me.The main problem is this album is forgettable.  I've had to listen to it several times even to remember a lot of the songs, and even now I can only remember parts of some of them.  I shouldn't have to listen to an album 15 times for something to grow on me.  There should be a few songs which stand out imediately and there weren't, just a couple that later grew on me.  It seems when Rush tries to put out an album of more than 8 or 9 actual songs, not counting instrumentals, they lose focus.  If there's another album in them I really hope they take their time with it and really focus on the songs rather than just slapping every idea they have together and hoping it fits.  These guys are better than this.Overall this album felt like it was just all over the place with almost nothing worth coming back for.  If you're a Rush fanatic you'll enjoy it.  If you like Rush, but accept that not all their work is gold you may want to listen to it first, and if you like it then buy it.",Negative
"Nothing memorable, nothing melodic, no virtuosity displayed. Time to call it a day and move on.....This coming from a long time Rush fan.",Negative
"I'm sure that most 5 starts reviews here are from die-hard Rush fans that would have given 5 starts to any album labeled ""Rush"", even if it had has sound of their farts. I had to be skeptical to them and read low rating reviews first before buying this album!Where Rush found that ""brilliant"" sound producer? Did they listen to the complete result? Or they became deaf?Quieter moments are passable, but as soon as the guys start play heavy metal, it turns to the WALL OF NOISE! Drums sound like they were recorded inside of a barrel. Cymbals almost absent in the record. Bass guitar parts cannot be heard.Any garage band that has Apple laptop can make better sounding record now! This is shame for such a respectful and wealthy band as Rush to release music with so terrible sound quality! You guys couldn't find or afford better producer?I'm not very picky in the sound quality department, but if I cannot hear the music how do I like or dislike it?I gave it 2 starts for a couple of quieter songs I could listen and for the brilliant cover and insert designs. And naturally for Neil's lyrics.",Negative
"This effort by Rush is OK, nothing great, not a must have. Not nearly as good as Moving Pictures or Perm Waves or ANYTHING prior. I stopped buying Rush albums after Perm Waves so maybe this album is good relative to all their work POST Perm Wave. To me the songs are meandering, a lot of it sounds the same after a while. A few of the songs are overly long. Let me put it this way: think if the Ramones put out songs that were 7-8 min long. Those songs would get boring after 3 min. Well that is my feeling with some of the songs on this Rush album. Anyways, the last song is about the only one that stands out. The rest is ho-hum. I wish these guys would go full blown Rush 1 style ROCK, or, go ""SCI-FI"" with bass-pedal synth and long space-like rock like the days of 2112, Hemispheres, Farewell To Kings. Maybe next time. Glad to see these guys are still writing music but I'll pass on this one.",Negative
"wow....really....I bought it because I have every Rush release ever, a life long fan....so I had to get it.  I am more of a 2112 type fan but I still dig Power Windows too.  There was nothing here that caught my ear as being something special.  Sorry guys.  You let me down.",Negative
"Well, it appears to be official.  Rush is dead.  Oh, the band may play on, but their inspirational and creative way of making music had died a quiet death.  This collection is completely uninspired, even worse than Snakes & Arrows, which contained only a handful of songs worth listening to.  The musicality is muddy and uncertain.  The concepts are non-existent and the vocals are often actually boring.  Its as if someone put together some elevator music and Rush decided it would make a good album.  To borrow a line from ""Caravan"", I can't stop thinking this is the worst Rush album I've ever listened to.  The best way I could describe it is...boring.  I've been a Rush fan since the late 70's, but there always comes a time when a band need to accept the inevitable.  No one can continue creating great music forever.  Rush's time has ended.  The band has simply run out of ideas.  It's time to stop.  Now.  Please.I'll add that I scooped up this album when Amazon put it on sale and I'm glad I did.  I probably won't get more than two full listens out of it, so it certainly isn't worth more than $5 for me.",Negative
"Honestly speaking I am not one of these typical Rush fans that just absolutely loves everything Rush puts out... I honestly do not understand for the life of me how this album is getting 4 stars... I thought Vapor Trails is better then this album & that isn't saying much... I just don't get it.... Before any of you Rush fans attempt to try & rip me for saying this save it... I have decided to add more to my comment here & I still stand by my original review of this album... I do NOT like this album & I think that ever since Rush parted ways with Terry Brown they have lost a lot of his expertise especially in the studio & it shows immensely... After listening to this cd a few more times it just did not do anything for me... I believe that most of the fans here who are giving this album 4-5 stars are doing so more out of loyalty then anything else.. In my opinion their last good decent album was ""Hold Your Fire"" & in my opinion it's been downhill from there... Their best years were with Terry Brown hands down & if he were to come back you'd hear a major difference in their music...",Negative
"Ah! Brian Regan, the bastian of clean comedy in America whether he's family friendly, or not.  The question of clean comedy vs dirty comedy and right and wrong isn't what goes on in my head and I pity those who think it's about that (and I know there are more than a few in his audience).  There are funny comedians on both sides of the fence and Regan is squeaky clean which makes me look at him differently.  Kevin James is largely clean and others are clean and lame, but what's wrong with having a few jokes that don't fly with little kids and when was stand-up comedy about universal appeal or understanding?  Taking these things into account I understand where Regan is coming from being from a middle class Protestant household with history in Mennonite.  He strays from anything that would be impolite, crass, rude, or unappealing to anyone within earshot because the most impressionable and sheltering audiences run at the first sign of dissent, not to mention a dangerous tone of voice. This results in his comedy being akin to clown shoes, a prop that serves no purpose in the service of comedy. To others more accustomed to personalized comedy it comes off as less than honest even when he talks about himself or his family.  To me, he's not funny at all.  Even comedians I can't relate to are funnier. It just seems that he boxes himself in, rather than being himself and in the process he can't reach profound comedy, or entertaining humor at all outside of this sheltered audience.  If you're an adult and you like Regan I have no interest in hearing your tastes apart from him, he's that bad to me on this cd.  This started it all and I've seen his specials on TV thinking he must pick something funny off of the road and he's always terrible, worse even.  To those who love comedy and like to see clean done well, stay away from this man, he's killing the game.",Negative

"I gotta admit I'm a bit surprised at how generously people are rating this album.  I bought it because people raved about it so much.  My wife and I listened to it on our drive to Indianapolis this weekend and ... we found it very lackluster.  I'm not saying all other reviews here are WRONG, I'm glad they enjoyed it.  However, this album pales in comparison to other works out there.  It simply doesn't measure up to the likes of Todd Barry or Mitch Hedburg.  Not even close.It is an uncommonly clean album which is nice to see once in a while but I still just can't ignore that it didn't make me laugh much.  It went beyond being clean into JUST PLAIN NON-THREATENING and I wonder if that's what some like about it.  I would love to see more comedians out there who can do ""clean"" material that still sets people on edge.As for this album, I simply can't recommend it.  It feels very dated even though it's only from 1997.  (Carlin has stuff from the 70s that feel TIMELESS.  That will never be the case with Regan's album.)  He is not the skilled writer or performer on par with other guys out there.  But that's my experience with the album.  IF it absolutely makes someone else's day brighter, that's great.",Negative

"MeTalHeaD4Ever ""DEath"" pretty much hit the nail on the head. This sounds like Avril Lavigne and Evanescence mixed together, which isn't a good thing! The grating vocals have already been described. The lyrics are generic, nu-metal tripe. Cristina Scabbia could kill this new girl in singing and songwriting. The guitar consists of power chords and no soloing. Why have 2 guitarists if they do the same thing?! The bassist might as well just quit, since you can't hear him. The drums aren't special either.All Tracks: 0/10Avoid this garbage, and get Lacuna Coil's new CD instead.",Negative
"I'm willing to admit ""Cassie"" is a decent song. However, the album as a whole I hope I never hear again. I had a friend who would play this cd while I was in the car so thankfully I never wasted money on it. Lacey's voice is powerful which is great but would sound a whole lot better if she didn't use it.A lot of reviews seem to praise the song ""I'm So Sick"". It uses a very simple, repetitive melody which some bands can pull off but it doesn't work here. The same four notes stick in my head for hours along with Lacey's whiny voice miraculously getting more and more annoying each time. It sickens me that so many other listeners think this is good music.",Negative
"First of all the users who rated this 5 stars are all girls. I heard one of their songs on mtv headbangers and damn they suck pretty bad. Her singer its a mix between avril lavigne and evanescence. Their songs sound all the same i dont see any difference. This band blows ass if you want to hear real girls rocking maybe you prefer to hear Kittie, Arch enemy or My ruin.",Negative
"It has been brought to my attention, by the people who left comments, that the review I wrote lacked good judgement and taste. It is one thing to say you don't like something, but to be rude and belligerent is wrong; nevertheless, I still do not like the band, and, therefore, I won't raise the amount of stars I gave at first, but  I do detract the words Appalling and vacuous.Fans of the band, please forgive me for being rude.The original review is below.The four and one half star rating of this album is beyond me.  The music is substandard, the singer, appalling, and the lyrics, vacuous! If you are looking for a female-fronted metal band, buy Tristania, Epica, After Forever, or Within Temptation.  This is a ""Fly leaf"" from a horrible book!",Negative
"You would think this would be a good cd. It isnt. So manyproblems. The first single, "" I'm so sick,"" also the firstsong...see when you do that....the first single should neverbe the first song. It shows a lack of originality. The 1stsong of albums is usually one of the best. If the 1st sigleis #1, what does that say for the rest of the album?"" I'mso sick,"" is the best song on the album, and the heavyest.Again, that song is ka( Kick-a$$) but there are no songs asgood as that.It gets dissapointing after that.Songs are so-so. Nothin'new, same stuff you hear on the radio every day. There areonly a few other good songs. One of which is, ""I'm sorry.""One slow down song too, which is alright, "" there for you.""Pretty short album, the songs dont drag on, which is goodi guess. Every song except for the last song( last song is thelongest, another thing you shouldnt do) is about 3 minutes orshorter. The chick has a really interesting voice. But itdoesnt get used in it's full potential to songs on thisalbum, which is all-around fair.",Negative
"I loved seeing RED in concert in cleveland and looked up their cd on amazon. I saw Skillet and that they were rated 4.5 stars. I listened to skillet's music from both cd's and was turned off when the singer opened his mouth. The music was good, but the singer should not be in this type of band.",Negative
"I guess I can say that I expected this to happen.  John Cooper has always had some soft spot in his heart for ""chorusy"" sample songs.  With Collide Skillet had finally realized what their instruments were for....ROCK!  What's gonna really hurt though is going to a Skillet concert and having to hear these new songs just to hear songs off of Collide and the ""less than five"" songs before Collide that had any merit.  Rebirthing is definitely the highlight of this album, but since it was released a month early, I've now tired of it and was hoping for something to rock to.  This new album has alot of John's wife on it, bless her heart, and comes across quite ""abbaish"" and klanky.  The lyrics are ""obvious"" to say the least and the music sounds a bit on the half clap beat.  I'm thinking that The Last Night, The Older I Get and Those Nights are one song that was broken into three songs given their distinct lyrical delivery....somewhere between the level of Bon Jovi and Nickelback. The good news for Skillet is that this album should pull off a couple of top 40 hits for them, which is obviously what they were going for.  -Yours to hold- is my pick for first song in the ""hit"" market.  In the end what I totally understand is that after putting out a masterpiece like COLLIDE and touring that album for 2 years straight incessantly, the band had to feel a bit underpaid for their effort.  So now we have ""Comatose"" which should pay their bills handsomely and provide them a few spots on the chew gum/top 40/easy listening stations.  More power to you Skillet and thank you for that 1 great album that I will forever be thankful to you for.",Negative
"I can't believe it.  Skillet is still copying what's popular.They broke out onto the scene with their self-titled debut sounding like a blatant Nirvana rip-off on quite a few songs.  Turned me off from them and I haven't listened since.  But the Christian music scene ate it up like they do most all rip-off bands (Bride/Guns'n'Roses anyone?  Third Day's debut pretty much got popular off of bands like Hootie & the Blowfish and The Black Crowes, and when ska got popular what happened?  Christian ska bands started popping up.  Even Living Sacrifice went metalcore when it started to become popular and I used to love older Living Sacrifice...)And now Skillet sounds just like everything that is popular today too.I am sorry if my opinion offends you but I feel very strongly about it.I think the Christian rock music industry should stop copying what is popular and come out with something original.Greatest Christian rock bands of all time:Poor Old Lu (one of my favorite bands of all time..  the album ""Sin"" is pure brilliance)The Prayer Chain (mainly on the album Mercury.. it's like nothing I've ever heard)Mortal (never put out an album that sounded the same, were always evolving, but consistently unique)even Steve Taylor when he quit ripping off 80's musicAnd that's about it.Feel free to point me in the direction of some more ""original"" Christian rock bands, but for now I'll stick with bands like Tool who don't do what they do because it is popular.P.S.Other honorable mentions in the Christian rock scene is the Newsboys, and even Audio Adrenaline (on a couple albums anyway..  Don't Censor Me and Bloom)",Negative
"I have been a longtime skillet fan, and i am so shocked by all the reviews for this album. Ever since Skillet got a tad bit of mainstream success a few years ago, i have been so over this band.But when I heard Rebirth, I became interested in Skillet again. But when I bought this album, I quickly got tired of them again. John Cooper (Lead Singer) is married to keyboardist (Korey Cooper) and yet the album is all about broken relationships. So does that mean that the married couple is having trouble and just staying together for the band or what. I am so confused by that, and then I remembered if anyone christian band wants to be a secular artist it is Skillet, and I just figured they're trying to be more mainstream.If anyone knows anything about the Skillet history, you know that they just keep jumping from genre to genre and this guy here won't buy into it again.",Negative
"When I heard ""REBIRTHING"" on the radio, I thought, ""AWESOME, Skillet is back in force!""  That song is undoubtedly one of their most powerful blow-you-out-of-the-back-of-the-concert-hall tracks they've ever laid down. So, I waited with eagerness the release of the full album, refamiliarizing myself with the great ALIEN YOUTH and COLLIDE in the mean time.How disappointing, then, when I heard the rest of the disc!  The second track, ""THE LAST NIGHT,"" featuring wife Korey, is a nice follow up to REBIRTHING, no doubt - but then there was another slow song, then a slight break with BETTER THAN DRUGS, and then slow, and then slow, and then slooooow . . . till I got to THOSE NIGHTS - and that's when I actually picked up the cover to make sure I hadn't accidentally gotten an Audio Adrenaline CD (those ""Oh-Oh-Ohs"" in the backing vocals . . . COME ON, MAN!)  Sadly, the rock edge is just missing this time.  Skillet started with grunge, then segued into industrial a bit before landing firmly in hard rock with ALIEN YOUTH and COLLIDE, their best works to date.  This is a sad turn into more mellow territory.  It is still loud, but it just lacks the emotional punch and verve of the previous releases.  I don't mind some slower songs, in fact I've always liked them before.  But when its track after track, it just gets disappointing!  Like the reviewer below said, this album seems geared for a different audience, a more mainstream audience that likes catchy ballads - it is not the disk that long-time fans of this stellar band deserve!  I hope they will return to edgier sounds in their subsequent releases.I give it two stars for REBIRTHING, which is one of their best tracks of all time.  But the rest of the album is sorely lacking!",Negative
"Alright, first off, I want to say that I loved Chris' last album. And I was excited about this new one and went out and bought it when it came out. I'm not impressed. To me, it seems like Chris used the album of the year award as an excuse to put out a crappy album. Musically, it's terrible. All the tracks begin to blend together, and after listening to it 3 times through, I felt like it had already been killed. Lyrically is where it's the worst. Songs like ""Made to Worship"" kill the album with their uselessness. Chris tends to state the obvious and is very repetitive. Where I have lost most of my respect for him is how he doesn't even write most of his music. Artists like Charlie Hall, Louie Gigilo and others write it for him. Look inside the cover if you don't believe me. The one that shone on this album was ""Everlasting God."" But guess what. Chris Tomlin didn't write it. Brenton brown did on his new cd. Unfortunately, this cd will still be raved his best one ever by those hungry for anything new from Tomlin. Hopefully he'll learn from this cd and put a less rushed, more creative worship cd in the future. While we wait for that, expect Hillsong United's new cd to rock the house.",Negative
"I really liked Mythology and Black Utopia, though the engineering / mix on BU was poor. But this album is even worse. Musically it goes no where. Almost like he was trying to copy previous attempts but ran out of ideas. The ""Featuring Billy Idol and Slash"" thing is an absolute joke. Some how he got these guys to do an absolutely horrible version of In The Summertime. It's so bad it's hard to believe any one would put it on a CD other than to draw attention and sales from the names. Too bad, I had higher expectations from this guy.",Negative
"I am goin' against everybody here, I just don't like this cd and I gave it to a friend of mine.  The title track (part II) is the only one that I can listen too, but not too often.  Sorry everybody, but I can't rate it as a five stars album just because everybody did.",Negative
"...And while we're at it, let's combine all the old reviews with the news ones, all the different issues, whether Box Set, CD/CD, CD/DVD, and whatever combination of sets this is now  in and combine them together so that no one really knows what is available. Whatever is now out, you can be sure it is NOT a single disc, decent sounding copy of the just the original LP. One reviewer (I think it was on the UK site) said he ordered the CD/CD version and was sent the CD/DVD version. Believe you me, I am not busting my butt right now trying to figure it all out. I have no plans of touching any of these issues.As regards combining all the reviews: I may as well start with the 30th anniversary issue before I start on the review of this atrocity of a box set (or whatever it is), because the  30th anniversary issue of Lark's was so unbelievably terrible sounding it made the others of the series sound good by comparison.  Out of all the disasters of that series, Lark's was the worst. I don't think one review mentioned the terrible sound quality of it, for example, the abnormal frequencies at the start of Easy Money making the vocals buried and just plain bad sounding. And again, like Wake and Islands, the 30th anniversary of Lark's had that terrible imbalance between the loud and quiets, making it sound muddy and thin. Virgin never seemed to have a problem like that before.  Keep in mind: one reviewer slammed this new issue because a spectrum analysis revealed the lossless format was really lossy. You wonder what the guy can actually hear, though....loss from what? The analog tape Lark's was recorded on?I hear the box has both a DVD-A and Blu-Ray. Why is this? Is this so if you have a regular DVD you can still listen to the DVD-A but not the Blu-Ray? But if you have a Blu-Ray, you can listen to both, of the same thing? This is the creepiest thing I have ever seen. And why no cassette? Ohhh, that's now the domain of the monopoly/cartel/professional censors, I guess.Here's what else: Another brick and mortar store FYE has gone under.  I think this is due to 2 reasons:  1) Sales of DVDs have been going down for years, and:  2) CDs are just too expensive in these stores. (The sale of CDs fluctuates from year to year depending on popular-taste artists like Madonna, Taylor Swift, etc.) They have to charge twice as much as the big dealers that list on Amazon. The only competitive pricing these stores have is when the supply of certain issues gets low and the average asking price begins to rise. But this only happens with certain `rare' issues. Clearly, this should not be. If Fripp and Co. and Ian Anderson and Co. and Mick and Co., and the rest of these musicians really cared about the preservation of music, they would do something to proliferate ALL formats and ALL markets and at ALL price levels.  For example, giving brick and mortar stores special pricing would go a long way to keep them from going extinct. And cutting out these very, very strange issues that make music senselessly more expensive. And playing around with their catalogs as if they were specially licensed limited edition compilation CDs. Those issues really are limited edition works of art that expire with time (God bless the people who do this for us, too, and let them re-issue, please). Crimson, Tull, Stones:  This kind of music should have a standardized catalog and not be treated like temporarily licensed material.Another odd development in recent years is vinyl making a comeback. I am glad for the people who want this format. I have seen some interesting things, but I am not interested in any new vinyl, just preserving the ones I do have. It was odd.  I went into one of the few electronics stores I know in this day and age, and they had a turntable for sale, but not a single tape deck. Now I ask you: what good is vinyl and a turntable without a tape deck? Who is going to play this new expensive vinyl until it wears out?Where is all of this leading? This kind of appalling, sloppy, self-indulgent, mixed-up format material, I believe, has the ability to harm the entire music market. I believe it is a threat to the preservation of music, including the music of the artists I have listed and who don't seem to want to do anything about a crisis that is clearly at hand in the history of recorded music.The people who are reviewing this issue positively are people who are being guided by their own special version of popular taste. Popular taste has never been a good guide to anything. Avatar is now the most successful movie ever. That should give you a clue as to the tyranny of popular opinion.""The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to common practice in the record industry. Discipline accepts no reason for artists to assign the copyright interests in their work to either record company or management by virtue of a ""common practice"" which was always questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible""  ---- it may be odd how these things can come full circle and end up being owned by other corporate interests, like the makers of DVD players instead of record companies. We don't need the self-destructive tendencies of the movie industry encroaching on music. It could be that doing away with the copyright altogether may be the best way to preserve this music and all music that is under such a threat right now due to the popular taste of people who don't seem interested in music at all but things like formats and spectrums...",Negative
"I really like King Crimson's first two albums. And ""Islands"" is pretty good too. But this one is way too odd and freaked out, more like avantgarde. Not really my thing, I prefer KC when they're a bit more melodic.Let's see how many ""Not helpful""-votes this will get...",Negative
"If celebrated film director Ed Wood (Plan 9 From Outer Space) made an album, it would sound like this.  The Transformed Man by William Shatner isn't flawed or ill-conceived, it's perfectly dreadful, reaching sublime and awe-inspiring new heights of schlock.  Each passing minute finds listeners recoiling in astonishment as they struggle to believe their ears. This  smorgasbord of embarrassing implausibility and pompousness is only possible through the offices of Shatner's hideously bloated ego which has blinded him to the project's breathtaking stupidity.  If the phrase, ""So bad it's good,"" is in your lexicon, The Transformed Man just might be your guy.  (Warning: Do Not Operate Heavy Equipment While Listening To This CD.)",Negative
"That's right, I said it.  I love this album, and yet I still give it two stars.  Let me explain why.I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each ""song"" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.  I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*...",Negative
"Let me put this as succinctly as possible. This release is a load of ""shat"".",Negative
"Here on CD we have the ""legendary"" album by William Shatner.  You may have heard his ridiculous renditions of ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" on theGolden Throatsalbum.  Actually, both of those songs are excerpts of medleys, with ""Lucy"" being paired with a monologue fromCyrano de Bergerac, and ""Tambourine Man"" being paired with an obscure poem called ""Spleen"".  See, the idea was to show Shatner's acting range by having him play two different emotions on the same track.  Of course, this being Bill Shatner, he overacts every emotion.  This is a terrible album, but it is the Holy Grail for collectors of bad celebrity recordings.",Negative
"I love this album, but from a purely technical perspective I have to admit it lies somewhere in between spoken word, a vegas cover act, and torture. It's awful, but hysterically awful.Shatner can't sing either. However, like Plan 9 from Outer Space, it's so nonsensical, it borders on great. I mean really, who thought setting up the theme from Cyrano and Mr. Tambourine Man as a medley was a good idea? His Mr. Tambourine Man is the most hysterically awful cover. Ever. The arrangement sounds like Mr. Tambourine Man does broadway, constipated.Spend the dollar.",Negative
"This CD is without a doubt one of top 100 worst recordings of the 20th Century - and in that sense it's a classic. Mel Brooks couldn't attempt this. I have listened to 100's of CD's in my lifetime. I have never heard anything this bad.It's a tour-de-force of horrible singing, banal melodrama, mindless ""poetry"" and shameless, unmerited conceit.I don't buy the line that this was all an inside joke on the part of Bill Shatner. That's just Trekkie spin. What you have here is one of the most blatant examples of a hyper-inflated Hollywood ego making a complete public fool of itself. If a normal person did anything like this, on the morning after they would seriously contemplate hara-kiri.Shatner's vocal theatrics are a mockery of the acting profession - enough to make a person laugh themselves into a hernia or lose whatever they ate during the last 18 hours - except that the joke is on him. He actually thinks he is amazing even the angels with his talent. But no. His rendition of ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" probably earned him a 600 year stint in that part of purgatory reserved for airport lounge singers.All said, this CD is so terrible that it has one redeeming quality - it would make an excellent white elephant gift next Christmas.",Negative
"When William Shatner interprets a classic song, it's eternally his! Littered amid the spoken-word recitals in ""The Transformed Man"" are mind-blowing versions of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" ""It Was a Very Good Year"" and ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds."" If you're looking for unintentional laughter, you've come to the right place.",Negative
"I won't really comment on the singing, because I am in agreement with most of the other reviewers, but in my opinion if you want to hear amazing voices sing Ballo, get the CD version with Pavarotti, Battle, Bruson, etc. Or you can get the other Met Ballo with Pavarotti (which I haven't seen, but I can't imagine it being worse than this one.)Something nobody has talked about yet is the production. By and large, this is one of the more pathetic productions that has ever graced the stage of the Met. The sets are simply dull, lifeless, and ugly. Perhaps if there was a halfway decent lighting designer, something could be made of it, but no. Oh, and the stage directing is pretty weak as well. I mean, one of the best moments in the whole show is in the third act when there is a giant crescendo that connects the scene with Richard by himself to the ball itself. You're going from a very intimate scene to a scene with many opportunities for brilliance, but instead we just have the chorusters march out on stage like it's night of the living dead. Just plain weak. AS a result this whole production is BORING. This is an opera that is tough to make boring, but alas, we have a winner.On top of all that, the picture and sound quality is horrendous. I am amazed at all the 5-star reviews for this DVD. Just because Pavarotti is in it, doesn't mean that it's worth getting.",Negative
"Everything is wrong in the disaster as all the charm, sadness and drama of this classic is gone. Charlotte should be a hairy spider with a Lucille LaVerne type voice, not a gorgeous arachnid with Miss Reynold's soothing tones. This is a story of friendship and self-sacrifice which is totally missing. And the tragic death of Charlotte, which is the highlight of the story, is simply glossed over. Along with The Cat in the Hat and The Grinch , Charlotte's Web is one of a trio of worst children's films of all time.",Negative
I am 50 years old but still have a nightmarish memory of this cartoon. I was twelve when it came out.The lingering unease and even fear is that its just a bad story. Do not attempt to put a big pink bow on the idea of a pig being killed for meat. Not to be forgotten it is cruel to young children's sensabilities because they spend the movie in animal-empathy.Bambi was just as bad. Watership down with the rabbits was horrific. Young kids really do plug for these critters . In plain language it is messed up to confuse animal cruelty with fearful child-hood necessities like witches or monsters etc...And I did not like the creepy tenacious latently venomous spider either. Blatently obvious to me at that age was Charlotte was too tiny and scrawney to offer any real protection. What ever she said could have been spinning lies. So an anxiety factor there for Wilbur having recently read Watership Down which they later made as a film and known about Bambi.THEN Wilbur is inundated with grief because the story-line kills her off. Nasty.Horrid Horrid Horrid Horrid. Life will be painfull enough without bombarding your kid with this insensitive nonsense everytime they might wonder about animals.,Negative
"15th November 2013It is now 13 years since my review and Amazon have once again added a review for a different product to a newer release.They have also included 3 VHS reviews that (other than the performance) have no relevance to any subsequent DVD release.The 2 DVD releases of this 1980 Metropolitan Production that I know of;(i) the May 2000 Pioneer Classics release (which is still available).(ii)the 2006 Deutsche Gramophon release.Not having seen the 2006 Deutsche Gramophon DVD I cannot comment on the quality of this release.There is also 1 DVD review dated December 1999, so perhaps there were 3 releases.My review therefore only refers to the 2000 Pioneer Classics release;1st July 2000Good Performances, Good Music and Production spoiled by the quality of the DVD. This production was described as ""A Manon Lescaut of fluid movement"", I have never come across a DVD with such jerky movement, in  addition there were numerous irritating pauses, the lips of the singers  were continuously out of sync with the sound (remeniscent of movies where  the sound was added later). Never having encountered this before I assumed  the problem was with my player but after trying the same disc in another  player with the same result, I conclude that the problem is the disc. I  found myself so irritated by this that after the first Act I turned the  picture off and listened only to the sound.Anyone who buys this DVD  should do so only with the proviso that they can return the disc if these  problems occur.",Negative
"I have contributed this video to the library because I couldn't stand the singing. Both leads sing uncharacteristically but consistently flat in the early part of the opera. The chorus is limp and other minor parts are are sung with too much wobble to be distinct. The strongest part of the singing is the excellent Lescaut of Pablo Elvira, but it just isn't a big enough part to make up for the rest. The orchestra plays well and the last two parts of the opera are well staged.",Negative

"No, I do no take Kiss seriously. But, at least, in their best years the released a lot of classic rock albums, with great tunes that influenced literally hundreds of bands to come.But in the middle eighties, they began to sell out to glam, and the mask was gone: the vanity and greed of Simmons and Stanley became clear for all to see. THat such hard-working and talented musicians became so shallow, it's something almost unbeliavable.This video (now DVD) is a fake from beginning to end, so bad as the newest SECOND COMING. The interviews are terrible, the girls aorund Paul Stanley's swimming pool are just models, most of them porn stars like Candie Evans and Blondi. As for the viedos, there are a handful of good old-ones, but most of them are from the glam phase.This DVD will add aboslutely nothing to you, just to Gene and Paul's pockets.",Negative
"There's nothing worth being ""exposed"" here, just the immense capacity of Kiss to record great rock music (in their first incarnation)and release bad videos....",Negative
"This release was an excellent overview of KISS's 80's videos when it came out in 1987, but even then it was incomplete.  Videos for ""Shandi"", ""Sure Know Something"", ""A World Without Heroes"", and ""Thrills In The Night"" are conspicuously absent, and of course the band released many more videos after this compilation like ""Crazy Crazy Nights"", ""Reason To Live"" (featuring plenty of TOTALLY gratuitous near-nudity), ""Let's Put The X In Sex"", ""Hide Your Heart"", ""Unholy"", etc.  Some of these are available on other old VHS titles lazily re-released on DVD without extras, but KISS really needs to go back and put out a definitive compilation of all of their videos, going back to the primitive 70's promotional clips for ""C'mon An' Love Me"" and ""Rock And Roll All Night"" and continuing right on through to ""Psycho Circus"".And while the in-between stuff here featuring KISS being interviewed in their faux communal home by former ""Fridays"" star Mark Blankfield was pretty much the equivalent of a ""DVD bonus material"" in its day, it's just distracting and passe now.  Again, a comprehensive collection of videos without any in-between crap is what this band is now most sorely missing from its catalog (and this is a band that really isn't missing anything from its catalog).  The ""Kissology"" DVD's are excellent historical documents of the group, but those only have a few token music videos on them as well.What I find particularly hilarious is how it retailed for the ridiculous price of $29.99 on VHS 20 years ago (and thus I refused to purchase it), and now you can get it for 18 bucks on DVD.  Even so, I'm still not going to cave in and buy it now, I'm going to wait a bit and see if Kiss ever gets around to re-packaging all of their videos on DVD for us.",Negative

"First -  I love David Gilmour...and believe he was more the 'sound' of Pink Floyd than Roger.  Upon reading reviews of this DVD ""David Gilmour in Concert 2002"", I bought it over the more expensive Royal Albert Hall DVD.  Mistake.  This one, though a quality performance, is not ""Pink Floyd re-visited"" and has ZERO songs from his first two solid albums from back in the 80s (David Gilmour and About Face).  It is a bunch of slow, 'On an Island' type songs from I don't know where and multiple versions of PF songs that all began to sound the same...  I had to fast forward several times.  The redeeming feature of this DVD is the Extras.  The DVD is 'only' $10, but I don't see myself ever watching it again so...not worth the money.",Negative
"I'm a big Gilmour fan - love his solo output... think Pink Floyd without Waters was just fine... think his vocals and guitar was what made classic Pink Floyd ""classic""...But, this DVD was sort of sad to watch.  The acoustic setting makes it all to easy to see that Gilmour has gone way past his prime.  He can no longer sing, and his guitar playing - without effects - is mediocre at best.I was absoutely certain that I would love this DVD when I bought it, but by the 6th song or so I was ready to turn if off.  I don't understand all the 5-star reviews... search out some of the lower reviews and you'll see they echo(es) my sentiment.BTW, for a better taste of Floyd from the 21st century, check out Roger Waters' ""In the Flesh"".  Even though I generally side with Gilmour in the Gilmour/Waters feuds, Water's DVD is infinitely more polished and entertaining than this one...",Negative

"I'm a huge Gilmour fan and was really looking forward to watching this DVD. I was hugely disappointed to see that the majority of the songs were done with his acoustic guitar.

Good lord, he looked like he had just come down from 20 years in the mountains of West Virginia...",Negative
"When I saw this DVD I bought it without reading too much about it - shame on me.  I love Pink Floyd and David's solo work.  In the endless debate of Roger Waters vs. David Gilmour my vote is always 110% in favor of David Gilmour.  From the front cover it was obvious that it would be scaled down a bit but I didn't expect it to be as scaled down as it is.  David talks to the audience a little here and there which is nice.  The bad part about it, however, is that he speaks so softly that you can't hear anything he says without turning up the volume quite a bit.  I would guess that the music is played at twice the volume as his voice when he speaks to the audience.The intro sets the stage for what is to come: a very, very slow version of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamonds"" which is played again later in the set at more of a pace that Pink Floyd fans are used to.  There are a couple times during the set when David plugs in the electric guitar for a guitar solo but throughout the set I found myself wanting to turn it off in favor of watching the ""Pulse"" dvd instead.Overall I was very disappointed and if it were easier and possible I would return it for something else.  I watched about half of the concert before falling asleep a couple nights ago and sadly have very little interest in even finishing it.  It pains me to rate anything by David Gilmour or Pink Floyd so low but for the benefit of others I rated it how I honestly feel.",Negative
"I know I am gonna offend a lot of Gilmore fans, but let's face it, Roger Waters at least has been keeping physcially fit.  The first thing that came to mind when I viewed this was, ""Gilmore has really let himself go.""  It looks like he has spent his free time eating donuts, ice cream, pasta and McDonalds.  And to add insult to injury, he plays wearing an old shabby t-shirt.I mean, if you are bloated and overweight, try to at least compensate and put on a decent shirt.  It is painful looking at his grimace through his fat face.  David, I respect your talents as a guitar God, but please get in shape or your gonna die early and not fully appreciate what you have accomplished in life.",Negative
This could have been a great trip down memory lane - except the DVD kept skipping and sticking....making it too hard to enjoy.  Am returning item reluctantly - this is definitely a classic concert.....cm,Negative

"Anyone who owns any &quot;underground&quot; Zeppelin performances (or, for that matter, BBC Sessions) knows that this is NOT Led Zeppelin at their best.  In fact, the 73 tour may well have been their worst.  If you're a  fan, of course you have to own this, but if you're a REAL DIE-HARD FANATIC,  then send some blank tapes to someone in a newsgroup and get yourself a  copy of a performance from the early days or the L.A. shows of '77.  Then  you'll REALLY hear what Led Zeppelin was all about... and you'll realize  that 'The Song Remains The Same' was an unfortunate mistake.",Negative
"I saw this movie for a class and, though I consider myself to be very much a Led Zeppelin fan, I thought the movie was terrible.  Part of the problem was that this is 1/2 very bad, pretty much plotless movie starring Led Zep, and 1/2 pretty darn good concert footage.What this movie does well is show the amazing showmanship and incredible magnetism of the band, something that may not be evident to those of us too young to have seen them perform.  Robert Plant is an amazing frontman and it was fascinating to see the unattractive Englishman with bad teeth (sorry, Mr. Plant) that I saw at the beginning of the movie morph into an amazingly attractive, vibrantly sexual performer by the end.  The raw passion of the band is laid bare.A drum solo from John Bonham that lasts (I kid you not) 20 minutes exemplifies my feelings on the movie, because though I found the solo electrifying in short bursts, I was also checking my watch by the end of it.Again, if you're a diehard Led Zep fan, you might like this.  I would still suggest you rent it, rather than buy it offhand.  If not. . .buy the albums.  Enjoy them, because they are phenomenal.",Negative
A good mixture of concert and short movie footage!  They were both visual and sound stimulating. Very good stuff that you will have to watch to believe in what I am trying to say.,Negative
"Are you people insane? This is horrible, the music is good yes but the footage is bad and it's hard to watch unless you're high. The fantasy scenes are just boring and you're thinking okay that's nice now get back to the concert footage. Zeppelin fans shouldn't waste time with this, instead you should check out their other concert dvd because it's way better than this.",Negative
"If this wasn't the only concert film available of Led Zeppelin it wouldn't be such a tragedy.. but it is.This is a second rate concert at best. At the time it was released Plant himself acknowledged its shortcomings, saying it simply had to be released, regardless of the calibre of the music. His words were to the effect that it 'certainly wasn't magical'. And it isn't.For those of us lucky enough to have heard/seen a magical performance of Led Zeppelin in their prime, this concert representation is a pathetic farce. It doesn't even scratch the surface of the brilliance of the band.On top of the mediocre performance, the editing is simply brutal. The 'dream' sequences spliced in and out of the concert footage are rather silly and beside the point, and even the live footage is so butchered that the sound/images don't match half the time.As for the 'dream' sequences themselves.... the fact that the makers of this film are trying to 'liven up' a Led Zeppelin concert should be your first clue that something is wrong.It's not that this film is so bad that bothers me, it's not terrible... it's just mediocre. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM! Led Zeppelin was one of the best rock bands of all time.. anyone watching this who had never seen a 'magical' concert would scratch their heads and wonder what all the fuss was about.Let's pray that somewhere, sometime, someone digs up some magic from the video vaults and shows the kind of mind-blowing concert that these guys were capable of.",Negative

"Have they separated the ""dream sequences"" from the middle of the songs?If they did, this will become one of the greatest concert films ever.If not, toss it in the trash can as some of the most embarrassing, boring statements ever.#1 kick A$$ band of all times.Having seen Zeppelin in the 70's more then a few times.Also going to see this when it first came out and watching people walk out in groups.Let you all know the original generation of fans were not pleased.Don't let the retrospective pushers make you believe this was the real deal.Even during the ""midnight"" showings in the theaters. Most went outside to have a beer, or smoke a joint.Or stay inside and sleep.After all it is Led Zeppelin, and it's true their worst was still better then most everybody else's best.Get the Zeppelin DVD if you want something close to the real deal.",Negative
"Since there's plenty of reviews concerning the movie I wanted to focus on the packaging.When this edition was announced I was quite excited to get my hands on a copy. I was more interested in the packaging including the shirt and other extras not included with the other editions of this release. I'll cut to the chase. The outer box is made from flimsy cardboard that can be easily damaged. I bought several extra copies since I wanted to have at least one sealed since I'm a collector. Both of those copies arrived damaged and I don't blame the dealers but whoever the brainchild was whom created this version. These two were also cut out copies. Upon opening my original copy I couldn't help but notice the cheap quality of the shirt included. Very thin cotton and after about 6 months of use there's not much left of shirt and it looks very worn now. For the most part I'm very displeased with the material used for this set marketed as 'Collector's Edition"" I think more thought could have gone into this and considering the original price when released, it should have!!!""Their are two versions of the ""Collector's Edition. I believe when originally released, their was material used that Zeppelin did not own the copyright to nor get permission to use so it was discontinued quickly. This version has white symbols like the picture used for this review. The second version omits this material and has black symbols which is more than likely what you will receive when ordering. You might want to check with your dealers to confirm what your getting and I'm still looking for the white symbols box.",Negative
"""Hideous"" is the best adjective to describe this pile of rubbish.I loved Led Zeppelin and was one of the first to see this film when it came out in Los Angeles in the mid 1970s.  I watched in dismay, as what once was a fine group of musicians descended into sloppy performances and laughable, amateurish ""fantasy"" sequences.  Jimmy Page's horrid playing mars the entire affair.  The group seems full of themselves, forgetting where they came from and the great musicianship that got them to the pinnacle of rock. Truly one of rock's great players, he appears drunk on his own ego, awash in an ocean of Jack Daniels. Anyone who paid to see these concerts deserve a refund, and then some.A much better version of the band is captured in the recent DVD collection of a few years back that shows performances from the late 60s into the late 70s.  The early stuff shows them at the peak of their powers: a tight knit group that roared like rolling thunder.  That's the true reflection of this great rock band, not this monument to rock sloth and gluttony.I read the glowing reviews with disbelief from others here, and they seem caught in a web of their own cognitive dissonance.  The music and playing is so poor that it's beyond subjective perspective.  This is a third-rate concert film and and a huge embarrassment to one of the greatest rock bands.",Negative
"I've been a fan since I saw them in concert in 1970. Their first four albums are classics. When this film first came out, I couldn't wait to see it in the theaters. I've only seen it once, and I thought the concert performances were HORRIBLE! So bad, in fact, I couldn't listen to LZ for a decade! Every time I heard their music, images of these god-awful performances filled my mind. I finally re-kindled my love for their music, and I never want to see this film again. If you really want the definitive dvd of this band, buy the 2 disc compilation ""Led Zeppelin."" It is STUNNING from beginning to end, and shows the band in all their glory. Why they ever released these poor performances, when they had the great performances shown in ""Led Zeppelin,"" mystifies me.",Negative
"If you already own the DVD of this concert do not bother to buy this BLU RAY disc, the sound do not improve a bit. The sound on the regular DVD is the same, the picture quality arguably is a bit better. This is far from true HD Sound...NOT RECOMMENDED.",Negative
"#1 I'm a fairly big zeppelin fan.#2 Zeppelin wasn't always great.They had their ""good times bad times""  haha couldn't resist.  When THIS DVD came out I bought it having never seen the movie or zeppelin live.  I WAS 6 when this movie was made.  The picture quality of this release was OK, THE SOUND WAS POOR.Did I point out I'm a Hi-Fi buff?  not surround sound, but 2-channel.When the 2 disc Led Zeppelin came out in 2003 I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!!  sound and picture.  I thought ""I hope they remaster TSRTS THIS way!!""  AND NOW THEY HAVE!!!  actually several performances from TSRTS were included on the double DVD and they sounded great!So, if you can afford to wait until November 2007 and have $35 to spend GET THAT RELEASE.Sadly, all the hoakey short films and sloppy guitar riffs will probably be intact, but also the moments of brilliance and magic.EDIT (12/17/2007)  THE 2 disc REMASTERED The Song Remains The Same looks great and sounds great minus some of the sloppy playing by jimmy, but its worth owning NOW with improved picture, sound and extras like extra songs and interviews... m.",Negative
"This is a bloated, self-indulgent, boring mess.  When this film came out, I remember thinking that if thisis the great Led Zeppelin, then they are quite overrated.  Some of the songs are way too long, the videosequences are almost laughable and Plant is either having a bad night or is already struggling to be thePlant of a few years earlier.  Get the excellent double DVD ""Led Zeppelin"" instead - way, way better.It not only shows the band at various points in their fairly brief history but does indeed demonstatewhat a terrific group they actually were.  In its wake, ""Song"" is now useless.",Negative
"Here's the format i would have shelled out money for: The whole concert footage, sans fantasy sequences, disc one; the fantasy sequences alone on side two just for period piece/comedy value. I can't believe the band even wants people to have to sit through this stuff any more. Even The Clash's terrible ""Rude Boy"" movie had an option on the DVD menu whereby you could just watch the great live scenes. Maybe they'll trot the fantasy-less version out next Christmas...!",Negative
I must have seen this movie 20 times at the local theatre. Friday and Saturday nights at midnight they'd play Rock n Roll movies. I have never been able to stay awake through the whole movie. I thought at the time it was because we were staying up past midnight to watch it and we were just to tired to make it to the end. So when I picked up the DVD and brought it home after not seeing it for so many years I thought &quot;I'm finally gonna be able to see this movie from start to finish&quot;. I still fell asleep. This movie has not aged well. I LOVE ZEP. But this movie reminds me too much of Spinal Tap. The dream sequences.........Why are the there? The band looks very bored. They also seem to take this whole 'rock star' persona way to seriously. Spinal Tap was a spoof. This was not and looks like one. Long live Zep...........but you don't need this DVD in your collection.,Negative
"The sound is poor as it prologic and very centre channel,the video is hacked up and out of synch with the energy on stage, the off stage sequences are rediculous and unnecessary But it is Led Zep and therefore good to watch Page at work. Bonham is an animal, I think Keith Moon would have gotten out of breath trying to keep up on the skins. I think the camera work spent too much time on Plant below the belt and we would have all been served better above the waist.",Negative
"First of all...this is not a reveiw of the actual movie. Or pehaps it is. This has nothing to do with the sound quality, which is very, VERY GOOD! This has to do with the DVD version (and maybe the actual movie, although I don't remember noticing it while watching it at numerous mid-nite showings so many many years ago). This is not my opinion....THIS IS FACT!! I am a guitar player (for nearly 40 years), as well as a dabbler on the keys. If you are a musician, you must have noticed it. The sound is NOT....I SAY THE SOUND IS NOT IN-SYNC WITH THE VIDEO! What amatuer let this slide by. There are many places where this is noticible. You can's miss it. Plant bellowing out a howl (like during RnR), yet for a split second, the mic is still near his waist...it's not anywhere near his mouth. I thought that this was just an overdub. But no because during the intro to Stairway, Page (my beloved guitar GOD himself) is doing his little riff on the  6 of his EDS and....my gosh people, the sound and video are no where near in-synch with each other. There are many other moments just like this. I can't believe Page let this thru the out door (pardon the pun). I enjoy this concert. I don't believe it deserves the bad rap it has recieved over the past 25-30 years or so. If you like live albums that have been totally redone in the studio, try Rush's Exit...Stage Left or Show of Hands. Live albums were (I say WERE) meant to be made in the raw!...mistakes and all. And there are many of them (LEAVE THEM IN...THIS IS LIVE BABY). Musically I rate this as a (LIVE album) a 5 star PLUS! BUT THE AWFUL PRODUCTION, AS WELL AS THE NUMEROUS PLANT CROTCH SHOTS ARE A TERRIBLE DISTRACTION....1/2 star.",Negative
"I bought a CD some time back called Encomium, which was a compilation of tributes to Led Zeppelin's music. I heard it once, barely scraping to the last number.The nauseating monotony of that supposedly iconic anthology is on display in this drone of a DVD as well. Jimmy Page whooshes, Bob Plant moans, JPJ tinkers around with jazz-like riffs, and Bonham squeak-shrieks for about quarter of an hour, followed by about five minutes of audience cheers, of which you wouldnt want to miss a second, would you.Video-wise, during these shrieks we see dawdly 'fantasy' sequences, with some backstage interludes,  where we get to see their acrimonious manager trying on his backend ""hip"" and gleefully abusing stadium employees.Not my definition of a ""documentary"". Not my definition of anything else either for that matter, with the possible exception of Stairway to Heaven.",Negative
"I use to be a big fan back in the day, and I recall enjoying this video a lot. Many years later, I am not quite so enthralled as I once was. Most of Page's solos are pretty sloppy IMHO, and Plant is off quite a bit as well. Some decent performances (Moby Dick is probably the best), but most are mediocore. As for the dream sequences, a bit goofy, but not that bad. Some interesting footage worked in as well. Worth a look if your a fan, but I would prefer to see a better performance from these guys.",Negative
"[Bad] concert footage and self-indulgent bio spots that say and do nothing, but that is what Led Zeppelin is; stated better than I,  ""Zeppelin are the most important band to say nothing"".Compare to the ""The Kids Are Alright"" and you then see what it should be about.signed,Led Zeppelin fan, but not a Led Zeppelin freak",Negative
"Since this set isn't coming out for another month (it's now October 16), why are people commenting on it? I can understand thinking or hoping for certain things to come out. But that's what forum's are for, right? How can you comment on something you don't own yet? It's like saying how the weather for the next month just sucks...or your next car doesn't ride as good as your current one does. Again, if you've got questions or concerns, post to the forum; that's what it's there for. Leave reviews to real reviews of the product and not crying about how you hope the quality is better than the other versions.Just a thought...",Negative
"I'd discourage anyone's interest for any of these performances (VHS or DVD are both of bad quality). The sound and picture quality has to be the WORST I've ever heard from any live band. The sound is flat and gets drowned out easily. No matter how far sound quality standards have changed since the 1976 release of this movie, the sound remains as horrible as ever. As far as the picture, I've done better framing with my home camcorder.  As a TV and movie viewer in the 21st century, I've been too used to seeing several frames per minute, while this movie often shows the entire stage of the band playing instead of cutting to different frames, and belive me.. you'll go CRAZY.  In addition, the DVD is exactly the same as the VHS since it was originally recorded with [bad] analong systems in 1973 and is practically incapable of a good remaster. DO NOT BUY THIS. I was very disappointed as a big fan of Zeppelin to say the least. It is NOT worth the money. To add to the poor sound quality, the band played pretty poorly too. Some renditions were way too long and needlessly draggy. I understand the improvisational culture of blues music, but .... Robert's voice is also very weak and stripped and you almost NEVER see John Paul Jones. (Did Robert and Jimmy eternally hate that guy or what?).  The whole movie has been over rated since it's the only official Zeppelin live performance (I'm talking the REAL band with Bonham and all).  The Stairway to Heaven performance is very over rated too.  I was so disappointed in that.  I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack either, since it's the same songs with the same POOR quality.  It also lacks the live version of ""Black Dog"" which was one of the only decent renditions in the whole movie.For new Zeppelin fans, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.  It will only turn you off from the band completely since it does NO justice to their real power and talent.  For older fans... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.To sum it up, it's just a HORRIBLE movie and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. No wonder it bombed at the box office in 1976.",Negative
"I'm not that big of a Led Zeppelin fan at all. I never will be. However, I thought that this would open me to liking this band. It  put me back a few steps.The movie starts off with a mob ""wacking"" (am I using that right)? A man without a face, a man that's a bear-type of thing like Star Wars, and one guy gets his head blown off and multi-colored blood squirts out of his head. Sounds like something they'd make fun of on Monty Python. Who are these people, why are they killing these other people?Then we see a kid my age on a bike, delivering a message to Robert Plant, who is watching his nude children run around in a river, with presumambly his wife next to him, I wouldn't know. We don't find out what the note says either.Then John Paul Jones in drag, and John Bonoham on a farm, Jimmy Page with lazer eyes. This is what the band does before a show? I didn't really find it hillarious.As for the music a third of it was quite good, but it just goes on and on and on. For example the Moby Dick thing, the ""orgasmic"" version of Dazed and Confused.Stairway to Heaven is the greatest song ever? Led Zeppelin is the best band? Stairway has the best solo ever? Bonzo the best drummer ever? Page the best guitarist? Plant the best singer? Gimmie a friken break. I say Hey Jude;Beatles;Free Bird;Keith Moon;Jimi Hendrix;Roger Daltrey. I believe that the best live band is Pink Floyd or the Who. The best musical band is maybe the WHo, and the best songwriting is definatley the Beatles.I'm not putting down Led Zeppelin. I have the BBC thing and it rocks. They have a number of good songs, but the group is very overated. I get tired of hearing ""get the Led out"", every friken day, not only on the radio, but from a classmate of mine.Skip this, get their studio stuff, because they are terrible live. Leave these kinds of movies to Pink Floyd or the Who, who are veterans at making interesting Documentary/concerts films, and also real movies with stories. Check out ""Live in Pompeii"", ""The Wall"", ""Live at the Isle of Wight"", ""The Kids are Alright"", and the brilliant ""Quadrophenia"".",Negative
Here you get both the standard and hd version . Put the blu ray in after the standerd and there's not much difference . Blu ray is grainy too ! .

I'll just watch my vhs version until Warner wakes up",Negative
"I agree with the other reviewer that this is the best Giselle I have ever seen. The second act, one of the peaks of European culture, is perfection in this version: bathed in moonlight, the young maidens dead before marriage, dance a surreal accompaniment to the tragic love affair of the two principals. The whole hallucinatory effect is supported by the marvelous music of Adolphe Adam: the quintessence of banality. the acme of vacuity, but perfection in this context. An experience to view and review time and again. Utterly divine. I want to givbe it five stars but the Amazon site is defective on my computer and will only accept one for some reason.",Negative
"I've seen Bessmertmova's Giselle on this video and on stage, simply disapointing. Since she was Bolshoi's former director Grigorovich's wife, it's easy to understand why she was the Bolshoi's ultimate Giselle and Odette, there were so many dancer's much better than this one,(Maximova, Kolpakova,Osipenko). Besmertnova has no technique, and artistically she's always herself,sad and melancholic,(and don't miss her unproportioned,huge hands!makes her port-de-bras always out of line, wrist-cracked). My favorite one? Alessandra Ferri,she's superb!",Negative
"The present DVD release of this historical film, highlighting two great Bolshoi dancers Natalya Bessmertnova and Mikhail Lavrovsky at their peak, is a gross insult. The producers of this hideosity have succeeded in proving the unthinkable: DVD can after all be far worse than VHS - in sound as well as in image.To be avoided at all costs.",Negative
"Let me say that Giselle is one of my favorite ballets; I love  Adam's music, the choreography and the story.I really wanted to like this Giselle;  I could hardly wait to get the DVD home and in the player. However, this shortened movie version of Giselle starring Natalya Bessmertnova and M. Lavrovski was disappointing  to say the least.I have a several areas of concern with this DVD production... to mention a few- The sets are ""barebones"" with flat color tones and meager drop back curtains; there is little or no ""scenery"" to give one the feeling of the rustic quaintness that seems to be the norm in other Giselles. The cast almost looks lost on this huge stage.- The music/audio is flawed: there is an annoying high pitched tinny quality to a lot of the higher notes throughout the entire performance: this is very distracting and although I could diminish this effect by tweaking my audio system,  I could not get this  problem to disappear entirely.-With the entire ballet only 82 minutes long,  they decided to leave out the Peasant Pas de deux at the end of the Act I....  Need I say more.-And finally, to me, Giselle has always represented ballet at its emotional best: with Adam's haunting melodies and the beautiful choreography taking the audience the full gambit between initial happiness and gaiety to final sadness and grief. In this production, although the dancing is technically good, it lacks any arousing impact; the performers went through the dance steps,but they didn't seem to be very convincing or committed in their acting. For instance, Bessmertnova tends to look very serious most of the time in the opening  scenes where she is suppose to be flirting and falling in love with Albrecht;  any rare smile seems forced and unnatural. (Then again, the camera settings were often so far back, that it was difficult to see the faces of the participants.)-On a positive note, however, the Wilis' costumes in Act II were stunning; the skirts were sheer,  moved beautifully with the lifts and generally enhanced the impression of  them being apparitions .All in all a disappointing DVD, with poor audio, devoid of any real beauty in the stage sets and lacking much emotional punch.P.S. If you were looking  to buy a Giselle on DVD I'd highly recommend the La Scala version with Alessandra Ferri and Massimo Murru. ( the sets, costumes and emotional content are all 5 stars)",Negative
"I pretty much agree with everyone else here, though I admit I am curious as to the color wash-out on DVD, I can readily understand how the VHS might be more enjoyable if the visuals are more strikingly transferred. The sound transfer is not very good, not horrible, but the very first chords are attenuated and it sounds like someone upped the volume than and was too lazy to do it over. It is filmed on a huge stage, so the dancers are given lots of room to strut their stuff, but a filming of a live performance might have been, well, livlier. There is an emotional flatness about the whole endeavor, though Act Two emerges more effectively in that regard than Act One. The score is cut rather significantly, yup those peasants are gone in Act One.If you want a GISELLE at a budget, this isn't the world's worst choice, but I'd save a few pennies and go elsewhere.",Negative

"This is the WORST transfer of a movie that I have ever seen.  Does Twentieth Century Fox know what was done with this movie?  They released it originally but I guess they are not responsible for the devastation that has ensued.  It is so poorly done that there are wavy lines at times and the color goes in and out.  It was supposed to be a digital transfer but it is a travesty.  This should never have been allowed to be released.  The original company that did this, CCM, should be severely chastized for even thinking about putting their name on it!",Negative

"MMT has long been one of my favorite Beatles' albums, and I was expecting this movie to be just as good.  After all, even though it originally bombed, a lot of other films which are now considered classics also did very poor business and got scathing reviews when they were first released.  Part of the reason why it originally got such horrid reviews was that it was shown in black and white, even though it had been shot in color and was really meant to be seen in color, like for some of the musical sequences.  You wouldn't get the full impact in black and white.  Just like there are some movies you can't picture being in anything but black and white, there are some movies that only belong in color.  This is one of them.  And it was also aired on Boxing Day, which wasn't the ideal day for most British people to be watching movies on television.  But even now that we can watch it at a more opportune time and see it in its original color, I still agree with the critics who originally lambasted it.  This really was a big ego trip for Paul.  He used to be my favorite Beatle, and he really does seem like a nice guy, but only a die-hard sycophant would deny that he does often come across as being a bit of an egotist and perfectionist, and trying to rewrite Beatles' history so that he comes across as the band's savior and the leading creative force, like when he once claimed that he, not John, was really the avant-garde one.  Writing a few songs like ""Helter Skelter"" and ""Fixing a Hole"" doesn't change the fact that many more of his songs were ballads and lightweight cheesy fluff (not that there's anything wrong with that type of music in moderation).Anyway, this movie is nothing like YS, AHDN, or 'Help!'  It lacks their wit, humor, and fun.  Even most of the musical performances aren't as great as the ones in their other movies, despite the fact that we're talking about 6 really good songs here.  There doesn't even seem to be any plot to it at all.  The concept that was so common in England at the time, getting on a bus and taking a day trip to nowhere, might have played out better had there actually been some substance to this film.  Basically all we see are some musical performances, some dream sequences, a few scenes of The Beatles dressed up as wizards in a laboratory, Ringo fighting with his Aunt Jessie, and the tourists doing not much of anything exciting.  I normally love surrealism, psychedelia, and all things avant-garde, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  There were some nice avant-garde and surreal scenes, like the ""Flying"" sequence, but they were overwhelmed by the lack of a plot and substance.  This is even worse than a bad home movie, although since The Beatles are in it, it can't be completely dreadful.  If you want to see a psychedelic, surreal, avant-garde, drug-influenced movie from this era, see something like 'Yellow Submarine' or 'Head.'  Those movies might be really weird too, but at least they have substance and plots, and inspired imagery and themes.",Negative
"I saw the color VHS-tape of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; a few years ago, and it's a boring, waste of time.  The Beatles take a bus ride through England and not much happens. It's really just a &quot;what I did on my vacation home movie&quot; that is just as dull as your next-door neighbors' home movies. The Beatles are/were musicans, not filmmakers. They're not Richard Lester,(who directed &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;Help&quot;), by any means. This was first a black and white tv special, that was later shown in color.  It's the first major project the Beatles did without Brian Epstein, (their manager who died in 1967), and it shows how important he really was. There are supposed to be a lot of &quot;in-jokes&quot; for people in the 'inner circle', but, the 'inner cicle' does not include the average person who will neither find the film funny, or interesting.  &quot;MMJ&quot; is the only real disaster the Beatles had, which isn't bad considering their large output from 1962 to 1970.  Get &quot;MMJ&quot; only in a group set, with something else, where it's almost a freebie, otherwise just buy the CD soundtrack.  &quot;MMJ&quot; isn't even bad enough to enjoy as a guilty pleasure.",Negative
"The quality of the VHS release is far superior to the DVD available in 2009. The DVD is washed out. The VHS has much better color and image-focus.The content? For me, this movie can be watched many more times than Help or Hard Days Night. Listening to the entire audio is fun too.",Negative
"I once bought a three-pack VHS collection of Beatle Movies that featured Hard Day's Night, Help!, and Magical Mystery Tour.  More enthusiastic about the other two--especially Help! because that's the kind of humor and plot I can relate to--I dragged my heels on MMT.  Fortunately, my niece watched it first and her verdict?:  ""It's so stupid it's like a retarded version of Sesame Street.""  Mind you, she was 12 at the time!  Despite her warning I put it in, and it was the beginning of counting down the longest 55 minutes I have ever sat through in my life.  Weird, plotless, and boring, I only sat through the entire thing because--just like a lot of other reviewers here--it was the Beatles.  So?  Just because you love an artist, actor, or musician doesn't mean you have to blindly love everything they do.  Well, I definitely don't love this.  If you're a completist, I'm betting you only have it just to have it.  That's okay, because I do that with artists like Basia.  If you're not, beware unless you only want to see the musical numbers.  Hey, up until 1980 or so, I grew up without too many musical visual aids and let my own imagination do its work.  There's my advice for you:  buy the soundtrack and let your own mind fill in visuals to your individual taste.  Unless this is given to you or it's super cheap, I wouldn't put it in my collection.  It's just too embarrassing for such a brilliant group to have sunk so cinematically low.  Guess psychedelics do a body good, huh?",Negative
"I have everything that the Beatles ever put out on vinyl and yes, I own a copy of each of their films. That being said. The movie was filmed in Black and white and recolored, its broadcast on the BBC at premier, I believe was also black and white which was a total waste as the color aspect of the film is lost and hence its a snore fest.Everyone is so strung out or post trip that really its a total shambles as far as any perceived plot. The only scene that gave me a laugh was of John shovelling spaghetti on a plate. Otherwise, the music scenes of I am the Walrus and The Fool on the Hill were a total waste even if you had dropped a blotter to relate.I rarely post really really negative reviews, but in all honesty, save your money, this sucks in a supremely quantum fashion. It should be a one star, I gave it 2 because I love their music so much. Sure, everyone had taken acid or done drugs, thats not the issue. This is a rambling directionless film directed and edited in some futile hope that you get it and in reality there nothing to get, everyone basically trips their nads off and you have to see the genius in it. I dont.Even under the guise of Pop culture or pseudo surrealism, this is a big can of suck. I am upset on 2 levels, 1) I cant ever get the time back I wasted in my life watching this and 2)its just so very poorly made.Part of me wishes I could give negative stars. One Caveat, it is still better than Ishtar, and on Ishtar, I will say the only positive thing I could recall was that the movie was shown in an air conditioned room.",Negative
"""Magical Mystery Tour"" has a fantastic soundtrack. Why not purchase it instead and save yourself the annoyance this DVD will bring? There is plenty of great raw material here. The concept of a bus trip with annoying, eccentric characters is very sound. This could have been a marvelous, psychedelic update to ""Help"" or ""A Hard Days' Night."" Instead, it's a disaster. The Beatles' performances (save Ringo) are actually the worst thing about this mess, which features sloppy editing and clumsy camerawork. The character actors appear to be having a great time, whereas John, Paul, and George look bored to tears or stoned - save for the scene where they enjoy a striptease in SoHo. If you are reading this review, you probably love the Beatles so please - just buy the soundtrack and enjoy what the Beatles were best at. If you must see late 1960s British films, try ""Blow Up"" or ""The Italian Job"" or ""Alfie."" If psychedelicia is what you want, try ""The Trip."" Just don't buy this movie.",Negative
"I had seen this many years ago so I knew what to expect - if you don't know, don't expect something like ""A Hard Days Night"".  This is a very eccentric sales pitch for their new album at the time ""Magical Mystery Tour"".  The credits list Ringo as the director of photography, and maybe it's true - but he's a better drummer and human being than either a director or photographer.  Yet, there is much to appreciate in the historical content, and plenty to put a smile on the face of a fan.  I was disappointed in the video quality, it was apparently taken from a well used and faded film.  Plenty of scratches are visible, the colors are very faded, and scenes with the Beatles in white tuxes are terribly washed out.  HOWEVER, if you already have everything else of theirs, you may yet enjoy some of this video. If nothing else, see where the band ""Death Cab for Cutie"" got their name.",Negative
"On one hand, I'm keeping it as nostalgia; on the other hand, it's barely a notch above crap.The transfer is sad and tired, at times so overexposed there's barely a decipherable image.  From all accounts, Paul McCartney is credited (blamed) for the idea behind this misfire.  It was first shown in black and white in England on the day after Christmas.  (If this was meant as a Christmas present, I'd rather have coal.)For that time period, it wasn't particularly daring, it certainly wasn't avant-garde or psychedelic.  Instead, it runs the gambit from a silly home movie to an amateur production done by a class of grade school students.  The graphics are slapdash, the `story' aimless, noisy, and confused.  Paul poses constantly, John showed up late, George appeared self-conscious, but at least Ringo looked like he was having a good time.  There's an odd sing-a-long on a bus, a stopover at a strip club, a creepy nightmare sequence in a restaurant, and a weird production number for the finale.  The only segment that was halfway decent was I Am The Walrus.  With only a handful of songs represented, it's almost not worth the effort, especially considering they shot almost 10 hours of film to end up with this embarrassing mess.Still, it is The Beatles; reason enough to put in my collection for future viewing (when I'm 64).",Negative
"I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it.  I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987.  It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality.  Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album.  So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the ""regular"" mixes of these songs away.The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced.  Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame.",Negative
"The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour was a mess anyway, but this DVD does nothing to help its reputation.  This version claims to be ""Digitally Remastered""...by `digitally' they must mean that someone ran a finger over the film before they copied it because the quality is very very poor.  But with all the flaws this DVD has, a decent version (as of 2011) has yet to be made available and so if you want to see ""Fool on the hill"", ""I am the walrus"" and ""Your mother should know"" in their full context, this is the only option available. I have it, but I wish I had waited for some better copy to come along (even if it never does).",Negative
"Don't get me wrong - I love the Beatles more than anyone. My comments are more about the DVD than the movie itself (which is still pretty bad, but, they were wasted). The company who made this DVD did a terrible job. The  video is &quot;dirty&quot; and full of &quot;short hairs.&quot; It looks  worse than a VHS tape played 100 times. Don't make this your first Beatles  video purchase; make it your last. And don't knock me because I think it  sucks - I'm telling the truth.",Negative
"This review is for anybody who enjoyed Yellow Submarine, A Hard Days' Night, or even Help! and is thinking that this would be a good, enjoyable follow up.Think again. The most egregious mis-step in the Beatles' career, this thing is, despite sporadic musical brilliance, an interminable mish-mash of stagey home movies, pretentious avant-garde hoo-ha (wrestling midgets! Chroma-key effects! Strippers!), and badly-acted skits.  The boys themselves, impossibly far from the fresh-faced naifs of A Hard Day's Night from just three years earlier, seem alternately bored (or, more likely, simply stoned beyond caring) and insufferably smug.Others have commented on the terrible video quality, which is an artifact of the project's origin as a TV special using early portable color equipment, but it's the content that makes it truly unwatchable.For the casual fan, this is simply a waste of time and money; any of the other Beatles movies or the CD soundtrack (or any other Fabs album for that matter) would be a more worthwhile investment.  For the budding Beatlemaniac, note that almost all the worthwhile bits from this film are included in the Anthology DVD set, including the proto-videos for ""I Am the Walrus"" and ""Your Mother Should Know"" (The other musical highlight is the instrumental ""Flying"", but the visuals here are nothing but tinted landscapes, so buy the CD and close your eyes and you won't have missed anything); far better to put your money towards a copy of Anthology than suffer through the drek here to get to the songs.  That leaves Beatles completists, who most likely have this already (and for whom issues such as watchability are beside the point).  You already know if you are a completist and don't care about this or any other review; if you aren't one, however, don't say you weren't warned!",Negative

"This is one of my favorite Beatles movies..but this DVD release is nothing short of sacrilage!  The picture is grainy and horrible, the audio is rotten...they even had the nerve to drop the speed on the reprise of the title song at the end of the movie (listen....the song SHOULD be in E...it's in Eb here!) This is terrible...I'm amazed someone as reputable as Amazon even carries it. Let's hope for an official release of the movie soon.",Negative
The quality of this dvd is terrible. The movie is great having seen it in much better quality on the BBC. Not even an official release makes this a clear sign to stay away from this dvd. Wait a few more years for the offical release from Apple and when it is digitally remastered.,Negative
"The master used for this copy is pretty bad, and it can not be from an original print.  If you don't believe me, just check out the MMT footage used in 'The Beatles Anthology'(it's fantastic!).  Apple must have access to the master, so my advice is to wait until they decide to issue this one themselves, maybe with bonus footage (are you listening, Apple...?)",Negative
"Those who read this review are, no doubt, familiar with every word, note, and film frame of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  In short, the DVD transfer is horrible.  Granted, the original 16mm film was not a professional job either, but this DVD appears as if it was derived from a very poor copy of the Beatles' film.I have seen MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR in many formats.  Years ago I found a 16mm film copy in the library.  I borrowed this print several times.  The the picture was very clear, but the sound was poor.  Later I bought a VHS copy through MEDIA.  The original VHS copy was about the same quality as the film, except that it was convenient to play on a video cassette recorder.  Still later I bought a ""remastered digitally enhanced"" VHS copy.  The picture was about the same as previous editions, but the sound was greatly improved.Recently I bought the DVD release.  I was somewhat concerned that the DVD did not display the Apple Logo, but I had heard that this film drifted into the public domain a few years ago.  I was sadly disappointed at the quality of the DVD.  Nothing was done to improve this copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR.  The color is washed out, picture is grainy, and the sound is worse than the original 16mm film.  About the only benefit of the DVD is that enjoys the semi-permanence of being on DVD and you can jump from chapter to chapter.As for the film itself, this was the Beatles first attempt -- outside of some of their music promos -- at making a film.  It was designed to be for television, so it was captured on 16mm color film.  The plot is simple: The Beatles and friends load onto a bus to take a sight-seeing tour of England.  These tours were standard fare for Brits in the late 1960s.  Along the way the passengers and crew of the bus encounter some odd scenery and situations.  In between there are some great Beatles musical numbers.Okay, the film itself is not Oscar material.  It is more like something you would expect from someone showing off a new home movie/video camera.  However, it is classic Beatles.  There was not much of a script for this movie and John, George, Paul and Ringo all took part in the production.  Apparently all four Beatles were involved in the editing, though never at the same time.  As such, the film took on conflicting directions depending on who was in the editing room.  Paul even slipped in his solo ""Fool on the Hill"" promo from Southern France.We have all heard the legend.  This film bombed on British television.  It was broadcast in black and white.  Later it was rebroadcast in color in a bad time slot.  Worse yet, the film was blown up to 35mm and premiered in theaters.  Still, it heralded the creation of Apple.  All four Beatles would be involved in numerous other film projects and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR was good experience.If you do not already have a VHS copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR, I recommend that you wait for Apple to re-release a restored copy.  On the other hand, the DVD is affordable.",Negative
"Have to agree with all the other comments about pirated copy. Good to have for historical value, but this is a washed out, low quality bootleg. The cover artwork is one step above old style computer pixelation and the label for the DVD is obviously semi-homemade.Unfortunately this is the only way to get this film (for the moment) as the general consensus regarding MMT is that it is a substandard product from the Beatles.Of course with the benefit of hindsight, its experimentation and sheer weirdness redeems it somewhat, I doubt we'll see any major remastering of this for some time. Buy this only if you're having a Magical Mystery Tour Ultra Fan Party and need a main attraction.",Negative
"Well as far as a film goes this is pretty stupid. However, I own a copy &amp; would never trade it in.I'm a Beatles fan - &amp; if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;.There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney &amp; Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - &amp; film it - &amp; wait for the magic to happen.The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself.",Negative
"Let me say that I'm a Beatles' fan, owning all their offical released material and 2 bootlegs of Decca Sessions and Christmas Records.But this is simply impossible...""Hard Day's Night"" was a fun and interesting peep into the Beatles's daily life, great script and acting.""Help"" was a mediocre adventure movie, still with a nice plot and reasonable script.""Yellow Submarine"" was just a cartoon.""Let It Be"" was one of the greatest recording session film ever made.And this must be the greatest boo-boo the Beatles' ever made. Can't comprehend until today, why...they even had the nerve to release it ?? There is no plot, script is horrible and boring, the cut into the magicians' place was simply meaningless...The only thing worth watching is the ""I Am The Walrus"" song clip...",Negative
"I must say I loved The Beatles in ""Help!"" & ""A Hard Day's Night"", & I just got this movie from the library today.  It's terrible...there's no plot.  The music was alright; it seems like every movie they made Ringo seems to be the center of attention, (nothing wrong with that). George only has a couple of lines in the movie (I should say words), which is weird.  There were a few slightly funny scenes in the movie.  Like when John was with the little kid on the bus, & when the man was singing on stage with the stripper.  The spaghetti scene was nasty.  I wouldn't want to buy this movie; only if it's very cheap, just to have it for my up coming Beatles collection.  If anyone really wants to see this moive; I'd get it at the library first.  I'm sticking with ""A Hard Day's Night"" & ""Help!""",Negative
"This has got to be one of the weirdest movies ever made and it isn't even weird in a good way. Its incredibly dull and all the jokes fall flat. Its hard to pick the worst scene since theres so many of them but I'd have to  say the endless scene where theyre all in the bus drunk and singing while  some guy plays the accordian. Then theres that other endless scene with  Ringos aunt and that old guy walking on the beach, and that awful stripper  scene,and...ect,ect. This movie takes self indulgence to the extreme. Oh  yeah, and that awful scene with the army guy and the cow, and that race,  and...Augh! the nightmares returning! I usually like weird movies but  you know, I also like them to be INTERESTING and this movie defiantly was  not. Oh, god the boredom of the movie still haunts me and just because Iam  the Walrus was one of the first music videos doesn't make it the least bit  entertaining or watchable.This movie left a very bad taste in my mouth,  especially that disgusting spaghetti scene. Its a dumb, boring,movie. It is  not at all like Monty Python which is actually funny and interesting. You  can tell that a group of acid heads made this movie, it is just so bad.  Hell, to make a movie this bad you would have to have bad taste to begin  with, never mind the drugs.",Negative
"This film and the accompanying soundtrack boasts the worst work that the Fab Four ever produced. The horrible sound, vaccuous, drug-induced lyrical crud and lack of real musicality signals this vomit as possibly rivalling the Bee Gees Sgt. Pepper's film as the worst rock film of all time. At times dressed in plushy outfits and filmed in the oh-so-blah countryside on oh-so-blah grey days, the four Beatles indulge themselves in being the cutesy and oh-so-witty(because we WROTE it that way) boy-band of their era. The result is the same as with every film that vainly tries to promote a band that is uninspired: a trash heap. The songs stand as simply the least well-performed and least interesting of all of the Beatles' repertoire. ""Fool on the Hill"" is a drab, lack-lustre experiment with pseudo-melancholic tonal structure and forced psychedelic-cool nonsense lyrics.It's just not entertaining, nor is it featuring any truly strong songs.The reliance on Brit terms (""Roll Up"") gets as boring as listening to another treatise on Brittania's rightful role. Lennon strings some poorly-conceived chord exchanges in a drab production of his (famous?) ""I Am The Walrus."" ""Strawberry Fields"" has no reference visually in this trash film.No script, no thought, no concept... this film pales in comparison to the other films by this most-important group. I recommend ""A Hard Day's Night"" or even ""Help!"" before wasting your time getting this trainwreck.Roll up... more like plug up... your nose.",Negative
"Well I'm a big fan of the movie, and I got it on DVD a couple years back. Recently I purchased a new copy at HMV and when I played it... IT WAS A HORRIBLE DVD!!!! The audio is horrible. I.E. At the end of the movie, when the reprise of the the title track is played It's original note is supposed to be E. but on the DVD, It's Eb! The picture is horrible, it's all grainy and washed out. I.E. In the Resturant scene, the spaghetti looks like lettuce and nachos. So all in all, you're better off getting the VHS. it has better picture and sound.",Negative
"The most devoted Beatlemaniac will have difficulty sitting through this self-indulgent TV movie. ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (1967) is best remembered for its music-video incarnations of ""I Am the Walrus,"" ""Fool on the Hill"" and ""Your Mother Should Know."" Despite moments of surrealist whimsy, the Beatles' lack of cinematic prowess is painfully evident. The soundtrack album remains a superior investment.",Negative
"Speaking as a true Beatle fan who, in my younger days, had a tough time acknowledging that everything the Beatles ever did wasn't perfect, I have to say this is one of the most painful things I've ever seen. But to its credit, you can't NOT watch it once it's on. You're just taken aback by how disjointed and bizarre it is.Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.But did you ever think that the best performance of a song in a Beatles film would be performed by the Bonzo Dog Band? (Interesting that Bonzo Neil Innes would later play Ron Nasty in the Rutles, isn't it?)If you must have this, have somebody buy it for you...",Negative
"As the old saying goes.....Buyer BEWARE! This is for the die-hard Beatles Fans ONLY. The quality of the DVD is worse than poor. It's as if the copy was made from a recorded VHS televised airing of the movie. The sound quality of the songs, though, are very good. But. The video quality is beyond awful. At times, the video is washed out and unwatchable. I only paid $8.00 for my copy. I would recommend not paying more than $2.00. Unless you are a very die-hard Beatles fan and MUST have everything they've done. I'm sure in Time, an OFFICIAL release of this movie will come about.",Negative
"The Beatles are my favorite band of all time, but there is simply no excuse for this travesty. The spaghetti scene is awful and painful to watch, the bus ride singalong is horrid and quite simply the Fab Four look [bad] in every sense of the word.

"I was so excited when I heard that there was going to be a Police concert DVD and I did not hesistate to buy it once it came out.  I watched it immediately and it was a real let down.  The people who filmed and edited this concert must have been drunk or stupid because they definitely did not capture the concert like they should have.  First of all, what's with all the shots of the audience?  The shot of the girl dancing during ""Message In A Bottle"" does not make sense at all, the shots of the audience grooving during ""Wrapped Around Your Finger"" are pointless, the shots of those weirdos waving to the camera during ""De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da"" are dumb, and the shot of some teenager dancing real fast during one of the last songs makes me want to go back in time and break the cameras that were used to film the audience.  Okay, there should be maybe some shots of an audience for a concert DVD but 98% of the focus should always be on the musicians.  Next, why are there almost no shots of Sting playing the bass?  Did the camera people forget that he was the bassist of the Police as well as the lead singer?  The camera only seems to be interested in his head.  The guy is an excellent bass player and the directors for some reason chose to ignore that.  Only on the multi angle tracks along with a few others can you see Sting playing the bass.  Another extremely annoying factor about the camera work is that the backing singers get way too much camera time.  Even when they are not actually singing, they are still shown.  Why would the directors and editors choose to show the backing singers dancing instead of the band playing?  I don't get it.  Other crazy choices for the filming include that stupid strobe effect on ""Spirits In The Material World"" and that slow motion thing on ""Tea In The Sahara.""  It's a shame that such a great band has a concert DVD consisting of garbage.  I only give it 2 stars for the sound (great sound), the set list, and the multi angle tracks.  Otherwise I would not give it any stars.  Someone needs to come out with a much better Police concert DVD that is filmed the way it should be.  I'm sure there is other footage that exists.  Otherwise Sting, Andy, and Stewart need to put the band back together so they could film some shows.  Wishful thinking, I know.  I hope the three of them are just as angry about this DVD as I am.  Save your money or buy it used for $5 if it's even worth that much.",Negative
"As a 25 year Police fan and recent purchaser of a flip-out, in-dash DVD player in my car, I was happy to find this concert dvd.  The songs are great as one would expect but the ridiculous effects, costumes, and poor direction really distract you from enjoying the concert.  There's way to much focus on Sting (wearing the most ridiculous costume of anyone)- it almost feels like watching [...].  Stick with the cd's.",Negative
"Do not waste your time with this one!  I saw this concert live back in the day and was very excited when I saw it on DVD. However, whoever the idiot was that destroyed what could have been a great show with a wave after wave of crowd shots, freeze frames, and silly cartoonish effects should be never be allowed to mix another DVD.  Many reviews are correct, the show is great, sound good, and I am a huge Police fan, but take it from a huge concert fan.  When the camera is on the band, which isnt often, they have head shots mostly, and rarely show anyone but sting.  The effects are so silly that ""every breath"" is entirely in black and white and much of it slow motion, stings face only???Matt D Knoxville",Negative

This has got to be one of the worst concert dvd's of all time.  I got stung by Sting on this Police concert.  The visuals are horrible home footage and the audio is almost unbearable.  I was NOT impressed nor would I recommend this to any Police/Sting fan at all.  Save your money and await a better dvd concert from this band/musician.  2 thumbs down.  It may be noted you cannot navigate from main menu all the songs easily;  you must use the FF and rewind buttons to fully cue up each song.  This dvd gives a really bad impression to folks that do not know the quality of the Police and Sting have made a great name for.  Bad mis-representation.,Negative

"My toddler loves the other three WDW sing-along videos (Campout, Beach Party and Flik). I rented this from the library and it seemed promising at first, but she lost interest by the 3rd song and went back to asking for Beach Party.As for me, I was born and raised in Orlando and went to Walt Disney World at LEAST twice a year from 1973-2003. I am a Disney fanatic and I love the theme parks. And a lot of adults wrote positive reviews here about this video. So I figured there was no way I wouldn't enjoy this, but I have to say I really didn't! It was... hmmm... well, tacky. It didn't bring back 'fond memories' of my trips; instead it seemed like a bad late night infomercial for some little rinky-dink attraction. This might partly be because it's for Disneyland and not the Magic Kingdom, but they aren't THAT different. It seemed like its creators were so determined to make it seem like ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" that everything was WAY overdone, and everyone including the 'guests' were overacting to the EXTREME for the video. It was clearly made in the late 80s or early 90s so the people looked goofier than Goofy. It would be great if Disney would do an updated, modern version of this and make it classier.Also - be aware there is a Haunted Mansion scene that isn't appropriate for kids under 5.",Negative
"Don't get me wrong, I love Iron Maiden. They put out some of the best metal albums of the 1980's. From the early-to-mid 1980's, they were a fierce live band. Maiden's problems with their stage performances began with their 1984-85 POWERSLAVE tour. Starting with that tour, they put on elaborate stage shows with props, enormous lighting rigs, and pyrotechnics. This may sound good on the surface, but it also meant that the individual band members didn't have to put as much energy into their performances in order to make the show a success. To me, when a metal band starts relying more and more on their stage props to carry the show, they become less interesting to watch. MAIDEN ENGLAND is a classic example of this.The show was videotaped in late 1988 during the SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON tour. Maiden's stage production is impressive. The band's performance is not. Guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray are virtual statues. When they do move around, Smith and Murry do it lethargically. This would be the last tour that Adrian Smith did with Maiden for ten years (he left the band in 1989 and re-joined in 1999). At times, Smith looks genuinely unhappy. The only one who moves around the stage a lot and does ANY headbanging is bassist Steve Harris. Singer Bruce Dickinson moves around to a certain extent, but he's no longer the wildman he once was. The extensive touring Maiden did in the 80's also seems to have taken a toll on his voice. Dickinson sounds like he's straining at times, and overall his vocals are terrible.Most of the songs have a going-through-the-motions type of feel to them. Songs like ""The Prisoner"", ""Killers"", and ""The Number Of The Beast"" were fierce-sounding live numbers in 1982-83. They're impotent-sounding here. I can't believe that age is a factor in this, because most of the band members were only in their early 30's at this time. Maybe it's the fact Maiden were so successful at this point that they felt they didn't have to work so hard on stage anymore. Success can be the kiss of death for a metal band. Another part of the problem is Nicko McBrain's weak drumming. He's a true liability as a live performer.One of the lamest moments occurs during the song ""Heaven Can Wait"". The band brings fifteen or twenty people on-stage to sing the ""Whoa-Oh-Oh"" part of the song. Yeesh. The band performs six of the eight songs from the SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON album. They're good songs, but again, the band just doesn't play them with a lot of fire.One of the few bright spots is Dave Murray's lead work. His solos on ""The Prisoner"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", and ""Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son"" are impressive. However, aside from Murray's guitar work and Harris' stage presence, there's little else to recommend. After watching MAIDEN ENGLAND, I understood why bands like Maiden and Judas Priest lost ground to thrash bands like (early) Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax, and Megadeth. If you're gonna get a Maiden DVD, get THE EARLY YEARS, VOL. 1.",Negative
"""Straight, No Chaser"" is a decent documentary, but what it fails to do is talk about the music and even less about the history of Monk. Yeah, it has rare performances never before seen, but this doesn't constitute a good film. It's only icing for the cake, but there's not a cake here. I felt it was a rather empty look into his history. I mean everybody who listens and are fans of Monk know where he was born at and how he started playing at a place called Minton's where he met and played with Dizzy and Parker. I would have liked to hear more about his own compositions and how they changed the history of jazz. Interviews with people like Johnny Griffin, Sonny Rollins, Ben Riley, Art Blakey, and other musicians who were more involved with the music making process would have been much more informative than simply interviewing family members and road managers. This may be okay for some people, but it didn't really sit well with me. I actually found these interviews really boring and lacking any kind of character.I will also say the documentary wasn't really well thought out. It seemed really scatter brained for lack of a better term. At one point, Monk is laying in bed asking for chicken livers, then the next he's playing out live. It's just really a mess of a documentary that really makes no sense. The historical value of the whole thing is incomplete. There is also no focus on his music of the 50s. It seems that his 60s quartet is getting all the press and unfortunately this is what makes this so frustrating, because Monk has made alot of music before he met Charlie Rouse, Larry Gales, and Ben Riley. As great as those musicians are, Monk was blazing trails way before he met those guys.There are some parts of this film that are priceless like the scenes where he is in the studio recording ""Ugly Beauty"" for his album ""Underground."" That to me is something that was unique and different to see, but for me there wasn't enough of this kind of footage to make it worthwhile.I will only recommend this documentary to hardcore fans of Monk, but if you're new to his music and want to hear more about his music or see him pick up the DVDs ""Thelonious Monk: American Composer"" or ""Jazz Icons: Live in '66.""",Negative
"Seeking a ballet performance of Carmen which reveals the erotica and sensuality in the role has become almost an obsession with me.  I have four performances, which have sorely disappointed me.  This DVD is a sad example of another disappointment.  I found the choreography a mish-mash of uncoordinated steps, whether by Carmen, or the men surrounding her.  So sad, because all the dancers, including the ballerina, tried so hard to make the piece come together.  The best performance of Carmen that I have seen is found on You Tube.  It shows Svetlans Zakharova in five excerpts from a Bolshoi performance of Carmen.  For some reason neither Amazon USA, UK, DE or FR carry this recording. How frustrating!  So go to You Tube, bring up Svetlana Zakharova and see her strut her stuff.  Her performance takes place in a bullring. Svetlana wears a red shift and later a black lacy dress.  She dances by herself except for a sequence with the toreador,  and another with the hapless French corporal.  Her dancing is sensuous, sultry, erotic and sexually stimulating!!  Svetlana's high extensions, lithe body movements, and her carriage, and her understanding of the passion of the music kept me in rapt attention. WOW!  Compare Svetlana's performance,as a soloist, and with the toreador and corporal, with that of the principals in the Australian Ballet exercise, and one will see what I mean. In opera performances of Carmen I recommend Anna Caterina Antonacci and Elena Garanca. But Svetlana, denied the additional asset of words and singing, makes her miming a more than admirable match for these two opera stars.  Talking of stars: Two Stars for this DVD, and they all belong to the Ballerina.  She tried so hard to please. King Arthur, Arthur Stanley Katz, 20 May, 2011.",Negative

"DuckTales is always going to be one of my favorite shows. When I was 5, the first thing I'd do when I'd get home from school was sit down in front of the tv so I could watch the Disney Afternoon block of shows, which had the almighty DuckTales. And in the last couple of months, I've re-discovered the show and was glad to see that it still holds up. Smart writing, a cast of memorable characters and great adventures make for a terrific show. Soon after, I tracked down a copy of Treasure of the Lost Lamp, which was only available from Disney's movie club or through the Disney Movie Rewards program, where it's constantly out of stock. I was excited to watch this with my daughter, who's also a big DuckTales fan, since I haven't seen the movie in at least 15 years.Like many films from my childhood, this is one that I should have not re-watched.The story starts out with Scrooge and the gang searching for Collie Baba's treasure in the desert. After navigating through traps, they find the treasure, which includes an old lamp that Webby takes for herself (well, after Scrooge figures that it's probably worthless). Their guide, Dijon, takes off with a little bit of the treasure, and it's revealed that he's working for a powerful sorcerer named Merlock. When Merlock sees that Dijon didn't get the lamp, he tries to take care of Scrooge and the others with scorpions, but is unsuccessful. Everyone makes it back to Duckberg, and Webby and the boys free the genie of the lamp, and the wish making begins. Ice cream sundaes, a baby elephant, stuffed animals coming to life, all kinds of fun wishes are made, but it's not long before Merlock tracks down the lamp. He possesses a jewel that, when combined with the lamp, will allow him to have unlimited wishes instead of the usual 3. The jewel also lets him change form to any animal he wants, making for a pretty sneaky enemy. Obviously, if Merlock gets the lamp, nothing good can come from it, so it's up to Scrooge and everyone else to make sure that doesn't happen.First things first, the genie in this movie is the most annoying character in DuckTales history. Upon granting a wish, he shouts 'SHABOOEY!', and that's something I could tolerate. But it's also a word the genie uses at random, much like how the Smurfs use 'smurf' for random words too. I got sick of the genie after about five lines of dialogue. He reminded me of a knock-off of Rip Taylor, and of course, the irony was that he IS voiced by Rip Taylor. The animation in Treasure of the Lost Lamp also didn't seem as good as that of the DuckTales show for some reason. Either how a character moved would look a little choppy in some scenes, or things weren't as detailed as they should've been for a motion picture that was released theatrically. It also doesn't feel like any heart went into the story or characters, whereas I could pick any episode of the show and get something much better. It surprised me to realize how boring a lot of the plot and dialogue was, and that this was probably the only time where I didn't care about what happened to Scrooge, which is a shock considering how much I love the character now after having read The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa. In fact, the only things I cared for much were Merlock's transformations (seeing him gasp as a rat actually made me laugh out loud) and there were a few smart jokes and funny names here and there, like Collie Baba. Finally, why does everyone have a brown bill? Was Disney somehow unable to use the orange-yellow paint for this movie for some reason? It was an eye sore more than anything else.The dvd didn't get much effort put into it- picture quality is below average with a lot of grain and scratches, almost like they just copied a vhs to a dvd but made it look a little sharper. The audio is just Dolby 2.0, with Spanish and French language tracks too, and English subtitles for the hearing impaired. The only special feature is a treasure finding game that you won't play more than once. No behind the scenes material, no interviews with the voice actors, no retrospective on DuckTales...just this game. Oh, the back of the box is worth a laugh, if that counts. Whoever drew Scrooge here did such a horrible job on his beard-feathers and hands that it's downright silly.It's too bad the movie bombed at the box office, as there were other DuckTales movies planned. Hopefully Disney makes another one sometime in the next couple of years, as I think if they put some effort into it, a DuckTales or Scrooge McDuck movie could really help their recent non-Pixar-aided track record. I can't recommend this movie to anyone unless they're hardcore DuckTales fans that want everything to do with the series and don't care about quality. I'll probably end up selling my copy and getting some more Carl Barks or Don Rosa comics instead.",Negative
"I first wanted to give this only one star. I saw it at a party when I was a little bit drunk and thought it was rather fun.

"Frank Zappa was a great musician, but he was not a visual artist and had no business making movies. &quot;200 Motels&quot; is boring and witless and seems to never end. It's like spending the night in hell.",Negative
One day i was looking through the cult classic section of my video rental store and I found one movie that I have not yet seen. That movie was of course none other than 200 Motels. I thought Frank Zappa and a movie= fun drug induced imagery and ridiculous dialouge about a little Jewish princess.I was horribly mistaking. The movie was painful to watch. It had no plot and nothing to do with a band going on tour. It was completely unfunny except for one part where Captain Beefheart's hat phonetically spells out f**k in the cyrillic alphabet.I watched this movie with my uncle who had been a pretty serious stoner back in the day when Zappa and Beefheart were still touring; he was a fan of both of these musicians. Even he continued to ask about the whereabouts of the plot or the too easily forgotten entity: entertainement.I was sober when I watched this movie and I would expect that that is not the best way to see it. Probably some acid or at least weed would be needed to make this movie at all tolerable.Zappa should have stayed with his ridiculous music.,Negative
"For fans of Chuck Jones, this is a great way to see some of his work outside of the Looney Tunes.For fans of the book, this is just a passing curiosity.Too many liberties were taken with the property. It only resembles the book in the most superficial of ways. The magic and charm of the book is lost in this animated version. I was very disappointed in it. Especially after wanting to see it for years. The songs in the film don't work as a way to advance the plot. They're just in there to be in there. They have no function at all.As stated, most of the charm and magic of the book is gone. You get the basic plot. Milo gets the tollbooth. Takes his journey to rescue Rhyme and Reason. Along the way are Tock and the Humbug. In a nut shell, you go from The Land of Expectations, to the Doldrums, to Dictionopolis, to Digitopolis to the Castle in the Air. 90% of the little side excursions are gone. No Valley of Sound. No Island of Conclusions. No cities of Reality or Illusions. No Alex. No 5/8 child. Heck, even the demons in the Mountains of Ignorance are not even that interesting. Rhyme and Reason are not much more than blobs of color. Almost like the animators just couldn't be bothered to even try and make them look like people. Tock is drawn all wrong. Short Shrift if wrong. I could go on and on.Since the book isn't all that long, I didn't see the need to cut so much of the more interesting parts out. If they had left out the songs, there would have been more than enough time to be more faithful to the book.I'll stick to reading the book. It's 100% better. Maybe in a few years some one will get the idea to make a more faithful adaptation. I hope so because if done correctly a movie of The Phantom Tollbooth could be really spectacular. This version wasn't.",Negative
"You can easily imagine how Norton Juster's whimsical, punning, and perfectly logical book might have appealed to Chuck Jones; his adaptation of Juster's ""The Dot and the Line"" had won an Oscar. Parts of this occasionally doleful transfer are effective, and the vocal talent is impeccable: Mel Blanc, Hans Conreid, June Foray. But the musical score is almost unbelievably poor (Leonard Maltin's capsule review refers to the songs as ""icky""), the character designs pale in comparison with the nifty pen-and-inks Jules Feiffer drew for Juster's book, and Jones's Milo runs his hand through his forelock so often you want to break his wrist. Worth seeing, for Juster's admirers and Chuck Jones fanatics. But only once.",Negative
"We were getting geared up for the Winwood - Clapton tour last year and thought it would be nice to check Traffic out live. I wish I would have saved the money as this was just terrible in every aspect - poor audio, poor video and a completely un-inspired and low on talent (at the time) Steve Winwood. Catch him later on as he actually could play additional riffs on his keyboard. this was embarrasing for anyone who thinks they remember Traffic, minus Dave Mason, who WAS the heart of that band. Sorry, Jim Capaldi.",Negative
"Prince Igor was Borodin's final work. It remained unfinished upon his death and was completed by his friends Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov. This version comes with a very rousing finale. It is heavily edited, cut down from 4-hours to barely 110 minutes but the main bits are here.The plot is very simple. Prince Igor and his son Prince Vladimir are captured while battling against the marauding Polovtsian tribesmen. Khan Konchak befriends his royal prisoners and proposes a military alliance to conquer the world. Igor refuses and escapes while Vladimir falls in love with and marries Konchakovna the Khan's daughter. The opera ends with Igor returning to his home in Putyvl where he is reunited with his wife Yaroslavna to general rejoicing. In the film there is a stirring coda as the assembled Russian armies march out of Putyvl for one final battle against the enemy with the chorus singing ""Hail radiant Prince... Lead us to Victory.""The 2-star rating refers only to this particular Kultur DVD. The film itself deserves at least 4 stars. It is very enjoyable. It is not an operatic production per se. It features stage actors in the main roles miming to the voices of the actual operatic singers. But it is all very well done. It was filmed during Soviet times so it was a case of ""No Expenses Spared"". All scenes were shot on location with authentic costumes and sets. Lavish would be a good description. From the opening sequence of Polovtsian horsemen thundering across the steppes, you know this is special. The producers even took the trouble of casting ethnic Asians as the Polovtsians instead of simply relying on face-paint. The Polovtsians were a Turkic tribe from Central Asia. Here they are made to look more like the dreaded Mongol invaders of a later era - actually many of the tribesmen look more Chinese than Turkic.The Kirov Orchestra may not be at its best but the chorus and soloists are excellent as are the dancers of the Kirov Ballet. I never imagined the Kirov had so many Asian dancers. The famous Polovtsian Dances has a splendid sequence with Polovtsian archers and spearmen on horseback showing off their skills in front of the Khan and the Princes. The Gliding Dance of the Slave Maidens with the chorus singing ""Fly away on the Wings of the Wind"" (Stranger in Paradise) takes place at dusk, under flickering torchlight, all suitably exotic as befits the music. A lot of the music has of necessity been edited out. But the Khan's aria ""Are you well, Prince"" is here. So too is Igor's aria ""No sleep, no rest for my tormented soul"". Vladimir's and Konchakovna's love-duet similarly remains intact - beautifully filmed on a moonlit riverbank. On balance it is an altogether admirable production, not definitive by any means, but highly enjoyable and to be treasured.I tend to stay away from Kultur as much as possible because of their history of terrible transfers but I just had to get this film. Bad move. This DVD is an utter abomination. It is a copy of a 1985 VHS tape which looks like it was itself a 3rd generation copy of the 1969 film print. No restoration has been done. The print is filthy. Dirt specks, flecks, white scuff marks everywhere. There is a yellow tint to everything. This film was shot on ultrawide 2.35:1 Sovscope (Soviet Cinemascope) to showcase the panoramic splendour of the Russian steppe and the spectacle of massed Polovtsian and Russian troops. What we get here is a cropped version - the two sides cut off to fit a standard TV. It is in a letterboxed 1.66:1. As usual with  Kultur, no anamorphic enhancement - why bother when the quality is so poor anyway. Sound levels fluctuate at the most irritating moments, multiple times within a single aria. It sounds like a warped audio cassette tape. The video looks as bad as a pirated copy. Actually, even pirates wouldn't sell something of this quality. Half the time I was admiring what was left of the movie, the other half I was cursing Kultur under my breath. We are already well into the era of high definition video, and Kultur still serves up this crap which wouldn't pass muster in the VHS-era of 20 years ago. This beautiful film needs to be properly restored and re-released. Hopefully, Criterion, or any of a dozen other niche companies who care for restoration and take pride in their work will buy over the rights to this film. I'd gladly pay double the price for a properly restored version. This Kultur abomination can then go straight into the garbage where it belongs.",Negative
"the whole concert was disapointing, vocals, camera shots, excitment from the crowd, song list. I wounder why they chose this concert to film, the weather was so bad. I watched this once and traded it in.",Negative
This is a great concert. The problem is the way it was filmed. The concert was shot using film. Whenever the camera passes in front of one of the stage lights it leaves a huge streak across the picture that lasts for a few frames. Really annoying.,Negative
"So, after 25 years, U2 finally releases Red Rocks on DVD.  News comes that we'll even get the full performance and everyone gets excited.  My copy comes in the mail on release day.  I pop it in and as I'm reading the liner notes I see that I Fall Down is not included because of a ""camera malfunction."" OK, I can live with that.I come to my favorite song in the show, Electric Co., and I am apalled that the song has been butchered during the ""Send in the Clowns"" portion.  Long-time fans will remember that the original VHS release included the entire song as Bono climbs to the top of a building adjacent to the stage and crouches in the iconic image from the cover of the CD and sings a snippet of Send in the Clowns by Judy Collins.  Subsequent VHS releases of Red Rocks edited this segment to remove the lyrical snippet to avoid paying royalties on it.  The new DVD version ENTIRELY removes not only the snippet, but Bono's climb to the top of the side building, so the scene makes no sense when Bono is suddenly absent from the stage for an extended period.U2, with all their money, chose not offer the complete original song to avoid paying royalties again?!?!  After 25 years and remastering and the chance to finally release this classic on DVD for old and new fans, they butcher it.  Totally and completely lame.As for the previous review, there is grain on the DVD, but remember, this was shot on video, not film and it is 25 years old.  I think in terms of image quality, the remastering is adequate. After all, this isn't high-def here.  The colors are washed out, but I don't think any of us expected perfection with this release.If you don't care that it is an incomplete show, not in widescreen format, and that the band chose to maim Electric Co., then this will probably satisfy you.  However, the band should have done better by their long time fans.",Negative

"I know that this my opinion will distract out but I don't think this one is the best ""Aida"" available on DVD. I like Alla Scala's the ""Aida"" with Pavarotti much more. Despite of everything, despite of terribly fatty Pavarotti hardly moves on the stage, despite of overloaded stage with huge pieces of noising decorations moved by ""slaves"" over all performance, despite of everything I like it more. Domingo is not on his best, his voice in many places on the edge his abilities, he breath too loud, in some places he just almost shout etc. He moves too much, he is looking in the ""uniform"" like Turkish policeman on the beach. He doesn't look strong, he doesn't sound strong, and he is not convincing. I think he got this role this only by his name: there were a lot of singers who had been able to sing much better. Sorry, it is Aida, it must be the perfect Italian ""belle canto"", but it is not.Pavarotti does make his Radomes perfect ""belle canto""!The stage decorations make me think that somebody has tried to cover the empty places with something. Everything is flat, no deepness like with Alla Scala, and no fantasy.Sorry, the ladies sound very nice, but forgive me again I don't think that such Aida would be the lovely women that I will fall in love so much that would betray to my ""Patria"". Sorry but Aida must be performed by young and attractive women, except for the case it is production was labeled ""for senior audience"" but it isn't. I do like enjoying the performance, other way I would buy the CD.The only person who on his place is Milnes: he always is brilliant, convincing and wonderful.",Negative
"While the sets are detailed and impressive, the production lacks ""atmosphere"". everything seems as it should but there is a clinical quality about it which makes it all a bit dull.

"First, I am not a serious opera critic, so I cannot address the quality of the voice issue in the way that some other reviewers have.  I am, however, a regular consumer of opera.  I attend the opera a couple of times a year and at the best of them, I am transported to a different place, lose all sense of self, time and place.  -  A few weeks ago I was at the Met and heard Flemming sing Violetta, for example and was nearly moved to tears.This production is disappointing to me because it has the feel of having been shot by a camcorder from the back of the room.  Having seen Terfel and Flemming's DVD of Don Giovanni, I know it can be done much, much better.  The problem here is that the set is enormous and the people are small.  The camera takes too many distance shots where you can't see the singers and so it feels tinny.If I want opera for the musical quality alone, I will buy a CD.  For a DVD, I want film-like production values and camera work.  This DVD is a let down.",Negative
"Eurotrash is generally applied as a term  by US commentators to criticise adversely European Regietheater productions, We in Europe think of Eurotrash as signifying vulgarity, over blown, ostentatious show. As such this Aida is a prime example of Eurotrash. What is Aida about? What does it have to say to us NOW?  Verdi's seriousness of intent is lost in a sea of literalness, ridiculousness and vulgarity. Opera for those who believe opera is a show, without meaning for the 21st Century. This great work deserves the seriousness of attention we apply to Shakespeare.  This is a totally empty spectacle with posturing puppets (who can sing,albeit well!)",Negative
"This is a good performance to watch for someone who doesn't know the opera at all, doesn't know great singing or conducting at all, and who will be appreciative of its considerable visual qualities.To begin and end with Levine's tempos are all wrong. The opening prelude sets the tone. It is taken much too fast [if you have other performances, please compare] which conveys a very business like mood to the piece. This feeling pervades most of the performance because of Levine's pacing. Second, to whip up excitement Levine overplays dynamic contrast. Yes, this is the grandest of grand operas, but there's a difference between grand and explosive. Levine goes for explosive.Second, Domingo does not turn in a good performance. In 'celeste Aida' he ends every phrase with a kind of sforzando that sounds like he is pushing himself tp use his last ounce of breath; and in the close of the aria he can't hold the the phrase long enough, decides to stop short, and then improvises with a repeat of the phrase in a quieter and lower pitch.Don't get me wrong. I think both Levine and Domingo are usually great and among my favorite performers. What went wrong here one can only guess.As for the rest of the cast, they are simply not on as high as the best of the past, except perhaps for Milnes.To give credit where it is due, the MET orchestra plays at an extraordinarily good level for an opera house band.Visually I must admit the performance scores high. So, for someone who doesn't have any ideas about how well the opera can be sung and played, this video is a good introduction to the wonderful music and to the spectacle. However, if you have a great performance of the past playing in your memory (my head is filled with the Milanov, Bjorling performance conducted by Perlea, an old mono recording now on CD that will make you forget that it isn't stereo or digital or video) you won't like this one.I've had this video for a number of years and played it, I suppose, again last night.

"I saw this movie in the mid-80s at a porno theatre on a double bill w/ The Decline of Western Civilization.An interesting experience-all through the movies middle aged men would furtively enter,watch the screen for 10-15 minutes and go to the other theatre.I'm not sure that they didn't have the right idea. There are,indeed, wonderful clips of live Clash,a wonderful band. But most of the movie follows the mind numbing adventures of a moron who somehow falls into a job as a roadie for the Clash.The band members themselves later largely disavowed the movie and it isn't hard to understand why.I am a rabid Clash fan,but there's no way that I could justify paying the price for this movie just to watch 15-20 minutes of the Clash.It is a tragedy that this band,one of the most exciting bands in the history of rock,doesn't yet have a good concert film. Joe Strummer's death may cause the surviving band members to go through the archives to put together a documentary that shows the band performing live.Until that happens I guess this is better than nothing, but not much.

There is a feature on the DVD that allows you to skip the junk and watch just the concert performances but even there, the film is poor.  I wish this were better.

I feel for Joe Cocker because this event whether he enjoyed the experience or not captured him at his peak and this re-issue should have been a modernised legacy of what a great showman he was in his prime.I put this on expecting my surround sound to fill the room with this great music but regrettably it simply doesnt have the spark.Buy it for novelty value but dont expect the Space Captain to fill your room with a wall of sound.",Negative
This dvd is a major let down. I honestly think the previous reviewer rated this without seeing it! The remastering of the film is bad at best.

Sure, they can get behind a phony ""Sinatra at the Palladium"" multi-media extravaganza where you watch 20-foot projected videos of Sinatra singing accompanied by a live orchestra thanks to ""unprecedented access to Frank Sinatra's film archives""... but they can't seem to get Sinatra's video performance legacy released appropriately on DVD...The classic 1960s, 70s, and 80s musical TV specials (A Man and His Music Part I & II, Sinatra+Ella+Jobim, The Main Event, etc...) are still being sold as individual DVDs at full price ($15-$20 each). They are each about 50 minutes long with ""stereo"" sound (actually ""2-channel mono"" I think) with no bonus features whatsoever, packaged in flimsy plastic and cardboard cases.Why don't they compile all 9 of the Reprise Collection Sinatra TV specials in a 3-DVD package with 3 specials per DVD? Price it at about $40-$50, include some bonus goodies (there must be hours of stuff in the vaults... better go with 4 DVDs!) and give this material the deluxe, classy treatment it deserves.Surely this would sell well enough to justify the minimal investment required (just repackaging/remastering the same old material for the most part). Wouldn't a DVD set like this be a better 90th birthday ""limited edition"" release than reissuing the sub-standard Duets CDs again? And what about all the amazing unreleased audio that remains stagnating in the vaults...? Get with the program, folks!I am truly very happy for all you Babs fans though! You're ""the luckiest people in the world...""",Negative
Do not buy this one for hundreds of dollars. The rare Sinatra featuring daughter Nancy is part of the 3 tape set Sinatra-Reprise Collection volume 3-for under $10!!!!!!,Negative
The music is inspired but the camera work was done by a LSD-soaked reject who had no skill. Warning: Buy this ONLY as an audio source because the video SUCKS. I want you to know that I am a huge Hendrix fan and I have  voraciously consumed his catalogue and enjoyed it for what it is: the work of a genius with a guitar who turned the world on its head with his incredible talent and pioneering creations. Buy something else: Woodstock!,Negative
"Right off the bat the cover isn't even a shot of Jimi At Berkeley and its all downhill after that. I have several close up slides of the second show that could have been used. Why the estate passes on their vault of Hendrix filmed material and releases this is beyond me. Bring out the Royal Albert Hall, Atlanta Pop, Stockholm 69, PLEASE. This latest release will not win too many fans. The estate has had 20 odd years to ""get it together"" and except for the box sets along with Isle of Wight and Woodstock, has failed miserably. Come on McDermott you were once a collector and fan. What Up?",Negative
"I might've expected too much .I'd seen Monterey Pop  , which is by the same director and liked the energy of that .I'd heard a lot about this 'legendary' film . Too much of it is too slow .We already know Bob is hip - luckily there's some different aspects to the film , when the promoter is talking with TV stations negotiating a fee for Bob's appearance .There is interrupted music making and it is made obvious Bob is a celebrity , but he spends most of the film behaving like an idiot . In a way , I suppose this is a 'puff piece' , something to make Bob seem hip to all the kids .Bob is acting in this , so why not just watch something where we're sure he's acting in character ? Hang out for the DVD release of Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid .Subtitles would have helped - a bargain basement release almost redeemed by the commentary .A disappointment . Let the buyer aware - rent it first .",Negative

"It took Mick Fleetwood only a few days to find a guitarist/vocalist to replace Lindsey Buckingham following his unexpected departure in 1987 for Fleetwood Mac's upcoming, already booked tour. As great as those two guitarist are (yes, two. even two do not equal the power of Buckingham) this DVD proves that Lindsey Buckingam cannot be replaced in Fleetwood Mac. Filmed at San Fransico's Cow Palace Arena, this video captures the 1980's alright, complete with glam, big hair, sparkle, synthesized sound and re-filmed close ups of Stevie (a la Stevie Live @ The Red Rocks DVD) wearing some pretty hilarious hats. In between the songs, there are few behind the scenes shots which clearly show Mick Fleetwood's hard living ways during this time. The music is well put together, but Lindsey's presence is sorely missed - How could you sing &quot;The Chain&quot; without one of its greatest links!? Christine delivers a few great performances, such as &quot;Little Lies&quot; and &quot;Everywhere&quot; (minus Stevie's add in lyrics) and Stevie gives an excellent performance of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; and &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;. &quot;Stand Back&quot; is included, but it is not her best performance of this show-stopper (check out the Live in Boston DVD or Red Rocks DVD). &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is heard but isn't seen as it is played as the credits roll at the end. For a die-hard fan its worth having, otherwise don't bother. Warner brothers could have picked a better release, such as the Mirage Tour '82 or Tusk Tour '80 &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; the album, which feature Buckingham, is an excellent work of art. Too bad the tour didn't follow that expectation. Instead, invest in &quot;The Dance&quot; DVD (truly incredible, with all of their onstage magic), which includes all members of Fleetwood Mac and was filmed in 1997 for their reunion tour.",Negative
"This DVD was filmed near the end of the band's ""Tango in the Night"" tour in 1988 and it is a letdown on many levels. Billy Burnette and Rick Vito, brought in to fill the gap left by Lindsey Buckingham's departure, lack the stage presence and vocal electricity of Mr. Buckingham. Stevie Nicks, looking like she'd rather be somewhere else, is a major disappointment. She was battling depression and vocal problems during this time and her performances seem phoned in only to be redubbed later. Only Christine McVie sounds great, but her material is often too bland and lightweight. As for the production, this concert sounds and looks like it was digitally created instead of recorded. Choose ""The Dance"" instead.",Negative
I would recommend skipping this one and buying the album &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; (which is a great album!) instead. The quality of this DVD is pretty good. As for the contents of this DVD... well...let's just say I laughed when I saw it. It's just not the same sans-Buckingham and where the heck is &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; (and yes...I know it's Lindsey Buckingham's song)!? I only keep this DVD for the Stevie Nicks songs. I think that maybe they should have released a different concert over this one. Skip this one.,Negative
"This video is perfect evidence of the downfall of the band after the departure of Lindsey Buckingham.  The late eighties saw the band become a slick &quot;hair band&quot; with little to offer that was unpredictable.  The set list from this 1988 concert filmed at San Francisco's Cow Palace  sounds overproduced and anything but live.  Moreover, the close-ups shots  of Ms Stevie Nicks (that were redone months later after she was unhappy  with her appearance) are downright comical.  It's obvious they don't match  the rest of the footage...What were they thinking.  The long and senseless  drum solo by Mick Fleetwood in &quot;World Turning&quot; is redundant and  again, comical at best. Thank goodness, this wonderfal band redeemed itself  with 1998's &quot;The Dance&quot; ( a much better buy). There is a God!!  Skip this lemon and go for &quot;The Dance&quot;",Negative
"Picked this one up cheap out of curiosity, and it's definately not impressive.  Granted, I wasn't expecting much, with a 1988 release date and only 60 minutes of footage, but it was even worse than I expected.Musically it isn't bad, Vito and Burnette aren't bad, Vito especially is a very capable and professional player, certainly deserving a better fate in the band than he had, and they both do an adequate job of covering for Buckingham's vocals.  The performances are well done, although none are exceptionally inspired.The real problems lie with the video, which suffers from poor camera angles, overall dark lighting, and, as mentioned, the pointless Stevie closeups.  While she is still a goddess in my eyes, the closeups (which obviously don't match what is going on musically) and ridiculous hair really get annoying after about two songs, and her voice wasn't exactly at her strongest on that tour.If, like me, you were interested in just seeing what the post-Buckingham tours were like, then it might be amusing, but don't expect too much.",Negative
I get an error message. The screen says it is not licensed for use in this country. Some Great Deal!,Negative
"5 Stars for Cream Reunion DVD5 Stars for Erics Robert Johnson DVD/CD last yearBut by God how OLD are you reviewers?  thanks again for wasting my money.  I read all this great stuff in here, and bah!Watch Eric Talk in RJohnson DVD, at the end how he says this is hard music to play, he has to think, on his own stuff he is thinking about last night, the next day, or whatever.right about that Eric.  he is so out on this and not even home.  lights are on but no one is home.  you can see it in his eyes.  for you people that cant simply read a person when they are on auto pilot, jeeez.  hello?and that camera work on 3. Sunshine.  Eric starts the solo and we get fast 2 second flashes of each band member OVER AND OVER AND OVER MY EYES STARTED TO WELD INTO THE BACK OF MY HEAD!somebody start a school for these camera/producer people!Listened with Sennheiser 595's, the best that I have found, had 555 for a couple years they are nice too, but cant touch 595's, pay the dif and see, er I mean hear.A good example of concert producing and camera work is the Led Zeppelin DVD set released in 03 and pick and Austin City Limits concerts on PBS.  why is this so complicated to learn?  one would think a monkey could do this right.",Negative
The concert is very good.  But the DVD is a region 2 DVD and I live in the USA.  Won't play.  I sent it back for a refund.,Negative
"First of all, let me say it's been a while since I've seen this video. However, there is enough that remains in mine own head to say what needs to be said about this video. It came out in 1985, so music from ""Purple Rain"" was the latest material. Somehow, even great stuff like that comes off as bland. It opens with a much-less-electrifying version of ""Let's Go Crazy."" The movie and album versions were much better, and for a live Prince offering, is very disappointing. There are also some more obscure songs filling the set, and those songs would be even more obscure today. However, the finale is what makes this video a must-see: a 20 minute version of Purple Rain! By this time, the audience is into the show. The instrumental refrains that play at the beginning of the song last for a few minutes themselves; it's actually a great experience captured live. The rest of the song completes the set, and even makes you think you've sat through something great... when you've only sat through 20 great minutes of some 90 minutes of mediocrity.",Negative
"I've tried from a number of sellers and this DVD is only available in import form(it says its Zone1-US but its not). That's a shame too because I have seen the old VHS version and its very good. Please, if you are considering buying this look at the back cover and see what zone its for. It'll save you a big headache",Negative
"Guess I'm not a van halen fan, didn't care for this, too rowdy and loud, could not understand them half the time too much noise in background",Negative
"From the opening screech ""Hello New Halen,"" Hagar quickly stakes his claim as the most annoying singer in the history of hard rock music: His voice grinds into your ear, his stage patter is low brow hedonism, his outfits are laughable, and he spends an enormous amount of time running-in-place.On this first tour with Hagar, Van Halen were desperate to prove they could soldier on without David Lee Roth, but Roth's absence is painfully noticeable in spite of the forced camaraderie on display here.  Eddie and Sammy put on a good show of liking to work with each other, but you have to wonder whether Eddie was really amused having Sammy's armpit shoved in his face and getting kicked in the rear to the beat of his songs, on camera.  It's a quick trip down sometimes, huh Ed?The set list of this show is pretty bland as Van Hagar had only one recording under their belt at this time, so viewers are treated to a heaping helping of 5150, with a few botched Roth tunes thrown in for the fans.  And if this wasn't bad enough, Michael Anthony is indulged with a bass solo that has you wondering why they didn't fire him on the spot and finish the show without him.But the real shame of this concert video is that Eddie, Alex and Michael were playing pretty well as a group during this tour.  Their timing is tight, and Eddie is given solo breaks where he really stretches it out to great effect.  Summer Nights in particular features a spectacular solo.",Negative
"This DVD is  disappointing, in a few aspects. Firstly the sound is weak, I found the audio mix to be off and muted. Secondly the video is fuzzy and poorly focused, moving around too much without focusing on Eddie or anyone else for that matter. The set list is barely passing at C-. If you want a better Van Hagar DVD get : Right Here Right Now. It has a Better Set list, better sound and much better Video. Now where is my Real Van Halen DVD? I want David Lee Roth ERA VH on DVD please.........",Negative
"Now I'm a BIG van halen fan and all but this is a little weak, worst off Sammy's-I wanna be Dave-antics are a little hard on the eyes, the songs sound good but when sung by a bette milder lookalike dancing around in one of the worst outfits I've ever seen (even for the 80's) the whole thing loses its appeal.  The stage show's lacking the flavor of anything entertaining and the drum and bass solo's are 4 minutes to long.  Good though is the fact that sammy doesn't butcher roth songs but unfortunetly does a number on his own, lets also hope he works on the audience participation skills.  Buy if die hard VH fan, skip if you like a roth and cherroo--extreme guy.",Negative
"They exist, please do it for the fans!!",Negative
"I saw it second run - maybe in 1972.It might be a well made film.  The music may be tremendous.Once I saw Hell's Angels kill on film, it was not about the music or about the quality of the film.  You see in the early seventies, I was tired of seeing death.  We just had years of Viet Nam on network news.  I did not wanna see any more.Now, we do not see the reality of war.  We do see massive amounts of gore in commercial film.  Too many people are used to see death in the multiplex or on cable.  I avoid those films.",Negative
"Unfortunately, thanks to propaganda galore, this concert went down as an infamous event depicting what can go wrong at free concerts and eventually symbolized the end of the flower power movement.  In reality, all this concert shows is what happens when a bunch of ignorant tuff-guys park their most prize possessions in the middle of 200,000 people and are in charge of security.  What did they expect, a magical halo around their motorcycles at a rock concert?  Of course people bumped their bikes, then fighting broke out and so on.As for the DVD, don't expect a documentary of a Stones concert because it's more a documentary of a riot.  Satisfaction and Jumping Jack Flash are an awesome beginning but it's all downhill from there.  The first few songs are from the 'Get Yer Ya Ya's Out' album in Madison Square Garden.  This is the best the Stones have ever sounded and if this concert were entirely remastered it would be the best DVD ever.  However, in this DVD most of the songs are interrupted with interviews or preparation of the concert.  And sadly three of the best songs, Wild Horses, Brown Sugar, and Gimme Shelter, aren't even live footage. They have to start Sympathy of the Devil over once and none of the later songs go smoothly, which is a real shame because the live footage sounds really good.  Even Tina Turner's incredible song is also cut short.This disturbing film shows a man getting stabbed, a fight scene with Jefferson Airplane, and mob violence throughout. This is a movie more for people who enjoy those Fox specials (i.e. When Animals Attack, Crazy Police Chases...), violent sports injuries or things of that nature. I can't see watching this repeatedly as some reviewers indicate. Don't get me wrong, the Stones sound good but it's tough to enjoy Under My Thumb when people are crying and getting beaten up.  Plus Mick has to stop and start singing throughout.  Maybe if you're board or unhappy with your own life, this will help you temporarily forget it. However, if you're a Stones fan who just wants a good concert to enjoy or fall asleep to at the end of a night of partying, go with another Stones concert, the Pearl Jam DVD, Rattle and Hum, or the Cunning Stunts DVD by Metallica which sets a new standard for concert DVDs.  Being desensitized to movie violence, movies like Reservoir Dogs and Braveheart are excellent, but real violence doesn't entertain.  This DVD is impressively remastered in DTS and has a great picture but poor replay value and incomplete songs make it not worth the money.  I only wish this effort had been used to remaster the entire Madison Square Garden concert and not wasted on a bunch of bikers who can't understand why the Stone's took song long to start even though the act before them, The Grateful Dead, cancelled their set at the last second.",Negative
"Arguably the BEST period for the Stones and we get 3 or 4 songs and a HUGE amount of documentary. It's fine to watch it once, but wouldn't it be nice if they put out a DTS version of all the MUSIC??",Negative
"Not this DVD, Video or whattever it's on nowadays again!!!!!!!It's a documentary of a concert that went wrong, due to the Stones hiring The Hells Angels as security!!!  Now, How exciting can that be??!!!!  The Stones start playing, they have to stop, they start again, stop again, and so on, and so on.A good video?  Hell no!Stones trying to cash in again?  Definetely!",Negative
What a wonderful documentary recording of the unfortunate Altamount incident occurring during the Rolling Stones appearance there back in the late 60's. Well-shot and well-made. A must-have for any serious Stones fan.,Negative
"This was pretty bad. I thought I liked the Rolling Stones until I watched it.Then I thought, well, if I don't like the Stones I can still like their music.After this program, I'm not even sure about that.",Negative
"This is a classic film that, alas, has not aged well. Unlike the double-vinyl release of the same show, this DVD rendering sounds like it was recorded thorugh a telephone. The DVD is, in fact, an excellent document of historical stuffs, but it suffers as a source of entertainment.  The sound is simply terrible (although dated, one would think better sound could be mixed in here).  Purchase only if you are a die-hard Bowie fan (like myself).  If you don't know Bowie, don't start here!",Negative
"I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to  run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it""s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it.",Negative
"D.A. Pennebaker's filming of the final concert by David Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust incarnation is a great piece of rock history.  Ziggy Stardust &amp; The Spiders From Mars is considered to Mr. Bowie's masterpiece.  Mr. Bowie not only created a classic album, but in adopting the androgynstic persona, he blurred the lines between male and female and spearheaded the glam rock movement.  Unfortunately, this disk is a major disappointment from the visual side.  The songs and performance are first rate, but the picture is horrible.  The disk does not clean up the blemishes.  It is grainy, blurry and just plain tough to look at.  The camera work doesn't help matters either as Mr. Pennebaker keeps the camera locked on Mr. Bowie most of the time and many times in close-ups.  This takes away from the full experience of the show.  The producers did do a great job in remixing the sound and the 5.1 Surround Sound mode is clean and clear.  You are better off buying the cd soundtrack version than the DVD.  This is for diehard David Bowie fans only because of the atrocious picture quality not because of content.",Negative
"I had high hopes for this video as I love Hank Williams and think he was one of the last and best  authentic country music people (unlike the plastic, blow dry, plastic surgerized men and women faking it in Nashville today). Country music today has been declawed and de#@%%@#, as has Latino music - all in the name of money and Clear Channel radio programming formats. I wish I could agree that Sneezy does a good Hank but I found his performance to be only vaguely reminiscent of our boy. Sneezy doesn't look like Hank except from a distance. His voice doesn't sound like Hank to me. His singing lacks Hank's straight from the heart charm, pain, and joy. The film is a bore and is cheaply filmed. If you can catch any of Hank's filmed appearances, you will see how he just lights up a stage. A disappointment.",Negative
This was a huge disappointment.  This &#34;Sneezy&#34; really wasn't up to the role.  I'm sure Hank Jr. or Alan Jackson or Travis Tritt...any number of people could have done a much better job.  He has no singing voice either...a total loss...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone....very poor.,Negative
"&quot;Your Cheatin' Heart&quot; was bad enough, but next to this clown, George Hamilton looks good.  Sneezy Waters does one of the most horrible impressions of Hank I have ever seen in my lifetime.  I find it absolutely hard to believe I am reviewing the same movie that others have given 5 stars and saying it'll never be forgotten.  Not one event depicted in this movie is realistic.  Hank would be rolling in his grave on this one!",Negative
"Having read the rave reviews at Amazon, I spent much more money to purchase this DVD than I normally spend on DVDs. Disappointed and even angered by this DVD, I have given it a one-star rating primarily to tip the balance against a great number of reviews that, I now realize, were not from an especially demanding and/or musically trained audience.I did not expect when buying the DVD that the orchestral performance would rival that of Klemperer. And so I was pleasantly surprised by Levine's spirited and tempo-appropriate--i.e., not in the current, anachronistic style of slow, overtly ""romantic"" Mozart conducting--if safe, conducting. The single star is not for Levine.The sung performances and filming--the raison d'etre for a DVD recording, after all--are unacceptable for a DVD of this price and are what merit the low rating.No personal offense, but Ariaza's Tamino is utterly uncharismatic, and his weak projection and faulty German diction never help. He is outshone by Papageno time and time again, and so the story becomes one in which Papageno is the protagonist, Tamino a relatively uninteresting subplot. Serra's Queen is uninspired, forced, and occasionally awkward. While the role is incredibly difficult, half of the battle for the singer must be not to let that difficulty color the performance and acting. Finally, Kurt Moll is sadly off-key and uncomfortable-looking in his roll as Sarastro. He comes across as being far-past prime.As disappointing as the singing is, the filming is absolutely horrible. We are repeatedly and unfathomably given far-away shots that leave the singers looking like tiny, lifeless dolls. Never, ever do we feel that we are front and center. I felt like I had been given the worst tickets in the house, and I felt cheated.I am a classically trained musician who has spent years studying Mozart and who holds a high place in the heavens for this opera, and I am a father of a two-year old who wishes to raise his child with a similar appreciation; I bought this DVD for both of us. If you, too, care deeply for this opera, and/or if you want to inspire your children with Mozart, I recommend that you look elsewhere. As I have not viewed any other Magic Flute DVDs, I regret that I cannot provide any recommendations. If you can recommend a better performance, I would be thankful to read your review here. In the meantime, back to reading reviews!",Negative
"This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.The spare stage settings create little of the ""Singspiel"" magic that this opera requires.Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina, Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro, and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.Sound and picture quality are OK.",Negative
"The stuff with DIO and IAN GILLAN kicks [butt]. Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules, Born Again, and Dehumanizer are great albums. Bad enough that the period between 1985 to 1991 was a weak period, BUT THEY ADD INSULT TO INJURY BY ONLY PLAYING THE LOVE BALLADS!!! THIS IS BLACK SABBATH??? C'mon now, there was SOME decent stuff from that time period...COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT, but they ruined this DVD. DO THE GUYS FROM SABBATH ACTUALLY APPROVE OF THIS STUFF BEFORE IT IS RELEASED?? ALSO, the DVD is NOWHERE near 85 minutes as claimed...",Negative
"I just got this.  I'm a huge Black Sabbath fan as well as a Dio fan.  I thought there would be a lot of good stuff from that period.There was some, but not enough.Most of it was interviews from people I didn't know were in the band.Part 1 of the Black Sabbath story was awsome. This part falls far short.",Negative
"ive bought this 2 times from 2 different vendors and both were defective,they were listed as region 1 but obviously is not, really pisses me off to throw money away on bad product!",Negative
"Boy, do I regret this purchase. And I got it cheap, anyway. The packaging looks nice, it has a nice drawing on front, the transfer it fine, but the ""movie""...a) there's no continuous story, nothing to incite us to keep watching. Its cobbled together from a few fragments of Pistols performances, an interview, and the rest is just irrelevent footage of things that aren't Pistols while McLaren (Pistols manager) raves to us.b) McLaren's narration is near-incomprehensible self-indulgent self-aggrandising. This film was his pet project, and he makes his mission bleeding obvious: to let everyone who ever liked the Pistols for their anti-establishmentism know they were merely sucked into his master plan. He basically wants to take credit for marketing the band to disaffected teens. My question is: why didn't he stick to a newspaper editorial? What he has here does not amount to a movie.The tone of his narration is so self-riteous and patronising you'd think he was Satan telling us he'd invented evil - which is probably how he sees himself. But as a character in a movie he doesn't look like a villain, he just looks like a boring little guy. Incompetent and foolish.c) But the real problem is this movie clearly wasn't made with the Pistols' consent. McLaren is constantly covering for the absence of actual footage of the pistols by silly tricks like the dwarf character, McLaren himself and sequences which seem to have gotten lost from an early Ken Russell picture.Finally) This isn't a Sex Pistols movie - let it be known - its a McLaren movie, and who gives a rat's about him.",Negative
"Really no one should really own this piece of filth. The images(pornography) are disturbing and really quite offensive. It is a sin just to view this with out ignorance of its content. Regardless, the DVD offers hardly any actually information on the pistols' career, but rather just shows all these performances of the band. It as well shows some cartoons which in those days, it would be unheard of to have the pistols animated.  Not really an essential for a normal fan, but it is still yet entertaining. It reflects the band rather well.",Negative
A nice film rendered un-watchable due to subpar sound and a barely visible picture. It really lives up to the title. This disc is a punch in the face to all who attempts to watch it. What a blatant rip off.,Negative
"The only swindle here is this movie. It is a farce and a lie and a slap in the face of the legacy of the Sex Pistols. And even as a piece of fictional filmaking, it's just not that good. As others have noted, the period clips of Pistols and solo Sid Vicious performances are the only redeeming feature. But the ""story"" as such is lacking in so many ways; the acting and script are hilariously bad and the film transfer is simply atrocious. Buy it if you will ( on sale or used if you can ) but please don't take it seriously.",Negative
"This is boring. Axyl runs around, Slash runs around, but who cares? I really like this band but..........I would rather watch a Styx concert!!! ARRGGHH.",Negative
"WEAK. That sums up this offering. Visually its an OK show to watch. Sound quality is also just OK. Performance wise...very flat. Perhaps it was the notoriously reserved Japanese crowd that failed to draw the best out of the Gunners on this occasion. Its a shame they could not have recorded a US show where the crowds are more upbeat(or flat out insane)in many cases and may have possibly elicited more energy from the band. Whatever the case...this show,sadly,has very little edge and is in fact sloppy and boring in too many spots. Many bands have done it right...AC/DC,RUSH and STEVE VAI are examples of outstanding,tight live shows caught on DVD...this one is NOT.",Negative
"Hey, I'll be one of many to state that "" Guns and Roses"" revitalized rock and roll. I absolutely applaud and cherish a couple of their albums; however, this DVD is boring - absolutely boring. I became more concerned with whether or not the washer was on the spin or rinse cycle.It took me several listens to get through this travesty. Seriously, this performance is that boring. I'll be so petty as to say,"" What the hell, Axyl? What were you thinking, when you and the band released this bull crap? You and those damn shorts. You were just so damn cute.""Bad asses of rock and roll? You failed here.The sound is flat. The performance is flat. I just didn't care. Maybe, just maybe, if you were all performing in some dive bar, I would have bought you a beer; then again,( I'm still being petty), I would have thought you were a wimp and had laughed at you.Save your money.

"I now own three different commercially distributed versions of ""The Return Of Spinal Tap"" and this ""Region free NTSC"" version is clearly the worst.I can tell that it is only a MONO transfer to DVD from the NTSC LaserDisc - which is crazy, because I own the LaserDisc and it's in superb digital stereo (one the best live stereo recordings I've ever heard).When I transferred my own LaserDisc to DVD-R I had to use my brother's PAL output player which does a dodgy inbuilt conversion of NTSC for PAL TV's. Using the right setting on the DVR for that type of input gives acceptable results, but the process does noticeably compromise the video quality - making it look slightly washed out.So the ""Region free NTSC"" DVD does have a more appealing look about the video - the colour and contrast are more natural. The major flaw (aside from being mono) is that the soundtrack is very slightly, but very annoyingly, out of synch all the way through - even though it is perfect on my LaserDisc.As others have pointed out there are several blatant or wildly wrong song titles on this DVD (eight wrong titles in all), and this fact combined with ""The Folksmen"" being called ""The Folkman"", indicates that whoever authored this DVD knows as little about the English language as they do about Spinal Tap - and they didn't look for the correct titles elsewhere.The other available version of ""The Return Of Spinal Tap"" is on the ""bonus"" DVD in the 4 disc French made (Studio Canal) boxed set, which comes in a Marshall Stack display box. That version is clearly made from the original film stock - it looks fantastic, BUT it is only the first 60 minutes (side 1) of the 110 minutes on the LaserDisc version AND it lacks some of the post production title and audio editing as well as being in mono - but with a MUCH wimpier sound than the mono audio of the ""Region free NTSC"" DVD.I have given up hope of finding an officially released stereo DVD equivalent to  my ""Return Of Spinal Tap"" LaserDisc. It took a bit of work, but I was able to use Sony Vegas video editing software to perfectly synchronise the video from this dual layer mono DVD with the stereo audio from my LaserDisc. It's been well worth the effort to have the best possible version in the DVD format. Mind you, if the producers of this particular DVD had done their job right, then everyone else would be able to own a DVD of the exact same quality.As it stands this ""Region free NTSC"" DVD is at best a two star version of what could have been a five star DVD.",Negative
"This is clearly not an authorized DVD version of ""The Return of Spinal Tap""; there are numerous typos on the cover, many songs are mistitled (""Sex Bomb Woman""?  ""Stonehedge""?), and, most problematic, the audio mix is horrendous.  I compared it to my VHS copy, and the audio mix is decidedly different - and much, much worse.  The video seems to be fine, however.  Still, I find myself wondering why Amazon chooses to sell products like this; it seems it must be illegal somehow, but I really don't know.  In any case, before you buy ""The Return of Spinal Tap"" on DVD, know that what you're getting is probably not an authorized release.",Negative
This was an &quot;OK&quot; concert; BUT out in the Red Rock canyon; the sound is displaced. The orchestra sound was just fine; but the Moody Blues themselves were &quot;not great&quot; to put it mildly.  I AM A HUGE MOODY BLUES FAN; BUT THIS DVD IS NOT THE ONE YOU WANT.,Negative
"Geezz!!! This is my introduction to a Moody Blues live performance on tape. Man, what a disappointment. First of all, what's that thing with two drummers? And Graeme Edge playing like he's on Prozac...Also, I never, NEVER, expected Justin Hayward to play so emotionlee alive. He seems to be playing just for the paycheck, no emotion at all, just going through the motions... John Lodge seems like a Las Vegas crooner, and porr Ray Thomas spends half of the show doing nothing but banging his ""pandeiro"".I like this band very much, but this DVD was a huge disappointment. I'm gonna sell it right now.",Negative
"I love Moody Blues, but did not enjoy watching this concert on my 55"" Sony TV, because the quality was worse than VHS. I am really surprised that the production company used cheap cameras and use cheap editing equipment. The post production was finished using linear editing system, everything looks pixelated. If this would have been filmed 50 years ago, I would say its OK. As far as fans, they are still enjoying it, that's why there are so many 5 star reviews.",Negative
"I wish I would have read the reviews on this video before I purchased it. If your wanting to see the bands perform this is a big disappointment. If you love Sonic Youth you'll probably like it and don't get me wrong there are bits of it that are funny but it's pretty much the lead singer talking and acting stupid through the whole thing. I didn't find that amusing at all, I hate that dude! I just wanted him to shut up and show the bands playing. Then it finally shows Nirvana and through every song the camera jumps around and it flashes to other stupid stuff so you don't see much of the band and what they do show is not the best of any of the bands. It's very unfortunate because it could have been a good video if they would have just filmed the bands playing and left out some of the other stuff. All and all from quality to sound it is not a great value for the money I paid.",Negative
I have on word for this no-excuse-for-a-movie: Yecch!,Negative
"This movie stinks like 13 year pizza with giant green molds coming out of it. Don't belive the title. It's the same gereration only a different back story. The animation is wooden & corny. The story is vague and there's a total lack of character development except from the 3 kids. The villain is 1D at best. The moral is phoned in a mile away. Overall, Never buy this junk food for your brains ever. I give this film a 0 out of 10.",Negative
"get this not so much for the concert but the very willful and willING advice of the trio. The concert is hardly descerned as they are too close up and not showing the instruments, only ridiculous facial detail. Yuck! The mates give a very good lesson in thier given area, clapton, who pioneered(i guess) the pitch wheel, via a foot pedal for the wangy sound(a lever on the tar it'self is used today). Ginger Baker goes over his various drum sections(in surprising detail for a young budding 60's musician) Jak Bruce speaks of why his ears pick up bass notes so well and his appriciton of classical bass sections. If your ears are as ""golden"" as your yuppish/yippish wallet you'll pick it up and appriciat just why he is so awesome in crossroads across from Clapton's howling gitar. otherwise mediocre concert value decent tips on gitars and other instruments don't pay full price, get at used rec shop for nearly free.(if a poor X'r of no stuff like mee).",Negative
"I was bummed to find that not one number is shown in its entirety, only segments.  The list of features is misleading.  You get pumped figuring this is the film of the album, but it's not, it totally craters.  The interviews, from it seems a year or so prior, are amusing.  Sample some pics from it with your Snappy and send it along, or donate it to the library (if you can itemize.)",Negative
"If you take one look at this documentary you will see exactly why Monty Python came along and mercilessly parodied this type of documentary filmmaking/interviewing (most well shown on their famous Arthur ""Two Sheds"" Jackson sketch). It is atrocious. I don't want to hear a 60-year old English man lecture me about improvisation, Cream's sound, Ginger Baker's style or the blues. I have known about these things for years. As historically interesting as they may be, I don't want to see some interviews with Eric, Jack and Ginger talking about what schools they went to, how play their instruments or how they write songs. And most depressing of all, I don't want to see some ludicrously dated-looking Lava effects instead of the band. No dedicated Cream fan wants to.I will say that the performance footage is interesting to some degree, but the camera work isn't very good and even when he's soloing, EC isn't even shown on most occaisons. The best close-up I saw of him was that of his butt! The camera was literally fixated on his rear end for about two minutes while he was taking a solo. To add insult to injury, the sound quality is, (to be charitable) poor for a supposedly professionally-shot documentary. I have bootlegs of this concert that sound better than this. Where's Martin Scorsese when you need him? Unfortunately, he wasn't directing films in 1968, so oh well. The only reason for you to buy this is if you're a completist and/or  curious.",Negative
"This is a documentary on Cream.  It looks like it was made for British TV.  It is about half interviews and half music.  It is only 47 minutes long.  There are no complete songs.  The songs start in the middle or end abruptly. The announcer talks over large portions of the songs.The picture and sound quality are poor. The actually camerea shots were poor.  It looks like it was pulled from an old video tape.  The DVD has no special features.There are some interesting parts to the interviews, where each band member explains how they play their instruments and how they acheive their sound.  But, most of it is a gloss over without really getting into the band.  There is no mention of how they formed or what tore them apart.There are some nice bits of them playing, but it isn't enough to justify buying this.",Negative
"I just had to see for myself and many of the reviews were right, bad! Sound picture and there was interuptions all through-out what was surpose to be a concert. I didn't pay much so if you want this DVD do not pay much for it. I love the fact that you can look at peoples reviews, it really helps with my sellections! Hope this helps yours",Negative
"I love Cream,so I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD.I was disappointed by both the extemely poor sound and video quality. The sound was particularly bad. I couldn't even hear Jack Bruce's vocals becase of the distortion. My favorite part of this DVD was interview part, where each band member spoke about the music and even gave a lesson on their instrument. That was really cool. I recommend that you rent this just for that part alone. This is not worth the purchase price.",Negative
"We know the boys were giving it their bloody all, based on everything we've read about their farewell. Unfortunately, this production is nearly ruined by terrible sound, echoing all over the place, and then the abysmal camera work, which reaches a frustrating nadir when the stoned cameraman goes absolutely berserk with the zoom apparatus, wanking that thing for all it's worth in an apparent attempt to simulate an LSD trip (?) (and, my god, the editor left it in!) Other than that the camera is content to crawl up the nostrils of the trio or examine their dental work.That being said, the interviews are rather amusing, with the lads innocently talking gear and technique.",Negative
"This is a disappointing making of Cream's farewell concert. You can barely enjoy the performances because of the absolutely dreadful editing. There are times that , during the concert footage , you would see a great wide shot of the band but then , suddenly , they would switch to a quick shot of Jack Bruce then a quick shot of Clapton then a close up shot of Ginger Baker and just change quickly from close ups of band members to the audience to the instruments. I mean , you don't mind A LITTLE editing of concert footage but the editing here for ""Cream Farewell Concert"" was so over the top that it was distracting. It really took away from the experience of seeing this bands final concert. Tragic!For example during the playing of ""White Room"" we get far too close to Jack Bruce's face for too long , and when Clapton's solo comes up they have a tight shot of Clapton from the shoulders up as he is playing and YOU DON'T SEE THE GUITAR! Then they actually vibrated this camera shot making it even more fustrating to watch! (the editing is so bad you wonder if this is the actual footage of him playing the ""White Room"" guitar solo). During the playing of ""Spoonful"" they decide to double expose the badly shot concert footage with lava effects. It was like someone spat on the Mona Lisa. Tragic. Absolutely tragic.Another odd thing about this footage is that it looks like the first song that was played in this documentary was the last song played in the actual concert. The song is ""Sunshine of Your Love"" and at the end of the song Clapton takes his guitar off , says thank you and waves to the crowd , you see Jack Bruce putting down his base and Ginger Baker walking away from his drum set heading back stage and the audience giving a standing ovation as if the concert was over. And this is about five minutes into the documentary. What gives?This was the 60's. So you wonder if the people who shot this footage and edited it had a little ""influence"" while making this piece. If you know what I mean. It certainly looks like it.The one good thing about this documentary is that there are interviews with each band member. Clapton(25 years old here)and Baker generously give a sort of music lesson on how they play their instruments. Young people who are seriously looking to become musicians may find those parts very informative. But those are the only redeeming parts to this documentary.Cream created some of the most memorable tunes in rock and roll. These guys were a real power trio ; an awesome band. This program does not do this group justice. The awful , horrific editing will give you a denied experience of what seemed like a fun concert to watch. You just can't enjoy it. And just for good measure , the DVD has no DVD extras.",Negative
"I'm not going to comment so much on this DVD as all the previous writers have covered all the bases. I would like to comment on the whole Cream package, movies, records, cd's etc. Cream was one of the best bands ever, I love them, but I haven't heard one recording that ever did them justice. I think the whole RSO organization used them as a money machine and then cast them aside. None of the recordings or moveis had any real technical know how behind them. One typical feature that has irritated me on a lot of British films are why in the world do they focus on the guitar players face during a solo (Clapton, Hendrix et al) and forget that they ain't singin' man they are playin' that thing they are holding. Anyway I have bought all of the Cream videos I could and just suffer through it all.",Negative
"They shouldn't call this &quot;The Farewell Concert&quot;.  There's very little concert here.  The thing is also very pooly filmed and edited.  There are bits and pieces of songs.  This would make a nice &quot;extra&quot; for a good video disc, but doesn't stand well on it's own at all.",Negative
"Much of what I could contribute has already been said about this DVD. The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo. I knew he was good, but seriously folks!! In spite of all the drawbacks, it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue. However, there is room for hope! PLEASE, if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen. Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance, plus rehearsal footage in a pristine, unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment!! This is the one and only way out of this disaster. What do you say? we're listening.........and waiting...and listening.",Negative
"Have you ever seen those long drawn out liner notes on a Rock n' Roll record albums written by people who obviously never listened to the music and knew nothing about the bands they wrote about and most likely thought Rock n' Roll was a passing fad. They are the same people who wrote the voiceovers for this movie. And they go on and on. Did you know Jack Bruce is an expert on Indian music? I'll bet even Jack Bruce didn't know that until the narrator let us in on this one of many ridiculous blatherings,  and constantly over the music I might add. And the camera work, sheer genius. And I mean genius if the intention was to totally frustrate the viewer because we never get to see Clapton's hands as he plays a solo or much of anything. There were, however, some very good shots of his nostrils during his solos, if you happen to be into some kind of strange fetish. And the band interviews are great. I would almost have thought that a sequel of Spinal Tap ""The London Sessions""  had been made if I hadn't know better. All three of them come off as blithering idiots. Not to mention the fact that Eric Clapton is one of the most over-rated guitar players of all time. But then the mediocre always seem to gravitate towards what is mediocre. Likes attract likes. Many of the same people who love Clapton and think he is a genius wouldn't have listened to him at all if he had been born Black because they can't even be bothered to listen to the Black people who originally played what Clapton plays and much better than him. I bought my copy for a penny plus shipping and think I overpaid. Want to see some great guitar playing and good filming of a concert? Get BB King live in Africa.",Negative
"Cream was a great band. Their importance and influence in the rock world (and jazz and blues, too) can't be over-stated. I love these guys.  Having said that, I must warn anybody who isn't aware of this movie - that it is one of the most horrible botch jobs in the history of rock documentaries.  I think everybody from the director to the camera to the sound must have been awfully stoned.  If you want to see a movie featuing Jack Bruce's acne scars with psych-ay-dell-ik sperm overlays crowding the frame, and almost unlistenable muddled sound in the background, then this film is for you.  Or perhaps you'd like to see the camera zoom in and out on Clapton's nose to the movment of his wah-wah pedal.I read in an interview that Clapton was so incensed when he saw this botch of a movie that he actually went looking for tony palmer.  I can only hope he found him and soundly kicked his ass.The only plus are the interviews with Clapton and Baker.  Baker comes across as incredibly stupid (which he most certainly isn't), but it's funnier than hell.  And his drumming speaks for itself.",Negative
"this sounds terrible.doesn't look too well either.the 2005 version is all one might need,it covers it all with passion and grace.time is fair.",Negative
"No way to sugarcoat it:  the director ruined this film, completely bungling his job.  He must have thought he was part of the band, or that Cream needed his help to rock the audience.  All kinds of cheesy '60s camera effects are deployed--rapid zooming in and out, rapid focus shifts from foreground to background, editing that looks like it was done by a food processor--showing a total lack of repect for the musicians.  Buy it, if you must; but you can enjoy it just as much by playing it through the stereo with the picture turned off.",Negative
"Imagine being given a chance to capture this band in what would be one of it's greatest performances and then film them lying on your back using a macro lens frantically waving the camera. It's actually upsetting to look at if your a fan and that's what this is. No redeeming value whatsoever (not even for the listening experience), just alot of nose hair, teeth and fractions of songs. This ""Remastered Edition"" by the way contains no re-editing...which means you get sharper images of the same crappy film. This is garbage and should be shelved forever. Don't even rent it.",Negative
"This DVD is strictly for fans of rock comedy, and fans of Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons who masqueraded as KISS from 1983- 1996. I refer to these 13 years as the embarrassing years. The DVD clearly highlights how a 1970's Super group became a parody of itself.Prior to watching Konfidential and Xtreme .... make sure you watch Spinal Tap.Ace Frehley - No RegretsIn Ace's book No Regrets he alleges that Gene Simmons is sex addict and that everyone who has worked with Gene in the past 25 years has either been fired or quit. Ace has the last laugh as he cites that KISS became Spinal Tap after his departure.Video's: The video's from 1983 - 1995 clearly tell the Spinal Tap story. I watched them in the way that one watches a horrific car accident. For Ace and Peter fans, this is the first ""official"" DVD whereby Paul, but mainly Gene, criticize them.  Gene's vulgarity really comes across in this DVD with lines like - ""she had an opening and I had a stiff proposition."" Gene thinks this is quite funny as he pauses for dramatic effect.Spinal Tap - in that movie that band has a drummer problem whereas KISS has a lead guitar problemPaul and Gene puts Ace down and then proceeds to criticize ALL the other lead guitarists.Vinnie Vincent - Gene alleges that Vinnie quote ""hung himself as he was handed the keys to the kingdom. "" I don't know what happended with Vinnie Vincent as Gene avoids any detail.Mark St John - Gene cites that Mark St John is a ""musician"" who plays too many notes.  Anyway ..... Mark St John's hand blew up to the size of a watermelon on the  eve of a European tour. He was dumped for Bruce Kulick.The 1996 re-union has NOT yet occurred. The DVD ends with Bruce Kulick in the band.  .1 Star out of 5 ..... due to the Vintage Footage AND the fact that Paul admits that Ace was a valuable contributor to the band.Prior to the KISS-ology DVD's I would have recommended it for the vintage clips from 1974 - 1977. As you can now view these clips on the Second KISSology DVD, there is absolutely NO reason to own this. I bought it by accident just prior to the release of The Second Coming DVD. More fool me. If you can borrow it from a book or video library do so.",Negative
"My biggest beef is that this video has dubbed the music from Alive III.  The video performances are not necessarily the ones that were recorded for the album.IMO, the only thing that saves this video are the clips from '75, '76, &amp; '77.",Negative
"...but it just seems to me that $$$$ is the driving force behind baby boomer, but particularly Beatles, reissues.  This has never been released on video, to my knowledge, so it is an event.  And it's nice to get the bonus stuff.  But I think the pricetag is out of line, priced too high just because they know they can get it.It just seems a shameless ripoff (kinda like gas prices).  I mean, these guys all donated their time, played for no pay, to benefit a country in need.  This kind of greedy, self-serving pricing seems at horrible odds with the original intent of the concert itself.  People say this was the Live Aid template.  The Live Aid DVD came out last March, a 4 DVD set that is priced at half of what this set is.Something's terribly wrong here.",Negative
"Sorry, but this has to be a dissenting opinion. As some of the other reviewers have noted, ""Superman and the Mole Men"" was later edited into a two-part episode for the George Reeves TV program, now rechristened as ""The Unknown People."" Sorry, folks, but in this case the ""edited for TV"" version is a distinct improvement and for one reason: THE MUSIC! The score used in the original movie is a pallid, third-rate job that does nothing to advance the action or to support the eerie, ""film noir"" feel of the camera work. But when the film was mixed down for presentation on TV, the show's producers had the genius to replace the film's soundtrack with some of the scariest, most vivid background scores then available.  (As a matter of fact, this weird and wonderful music - used over and over again as background music throughout the first, black-and -white season of the 1950's ""Adventures of Superman"" TV show - has been helpfully collected on CD by the Varese-Sarabande label. You can order it right here, at Amazon.com!The Adventures of Superman: Original Television Soundtrack (1950s TV Series)) Anyone who gets to know ""Superman and the Mole Men"" only through the original theatrical release with its substandard, tepid musical score will have no idea of how good the film really is, or understand how the effective use of great background music can turn a third-rate movie into a very good film.  Luckily for everyone, the DVD release of the first season of 'The Adventures of Superman' made both TV re-mix and original theatrical version of 'Mole Men' available for comparison.Adventures of Superman: The Complete First SeasonTrust me, after seeing the TV re-mix, you'll never want to watch the theatrical release again!",Negative
"Coltrane and his music is really genius. The same I expect from the movie about him.Why I consider it weak:1. It is only 60 min and not all the time is for his music. DVD can fill &gt; 3 h.2. Comments are interrupting his performance. The sessions are cut at the middle.I think I need to wait for DVD writer and create the movie that I want by myself. I want to have whole session of performance from Jazz Casual (weak picture, but the sound recording is good). I want to see as much as possible from Kind of Blue, My Favorite Things, Giants Steps and Love Supreme. I saw the parts from these sessions but I want to have all of it. I don't care that the picture can be weak, but I want to see Coltranes fingers and hear his sax.Also for music DVD it should be the option to play only music without comments, because after couple of times you probable want to hear only music and not listen to the story.",Negative
"I was very disappointed with this concert. It was obviously an ego stroke for Mr. Dylan provided by a bunch of Dylan wannabe's. A sad spectacle in my opinion. There were some standout performances though only a handful and not worth the investment in this DVD. They were Eddie Vedder, Willie Nelson, Johnny Winter & maybe Richie Havens. If you like these artists, as well as the other top artists in this venue I suggest that you purchase their performances when they are performing as themselves and not as someone else's alter ego. The icing on the cake was when Mr. Dylan made his appearance as the exalted one. His performance was awful and it looks as if he has lost his chops. I remember Dylan in his prime, I am a child of the 60's, and he is one of my favorite recording artists of all time. If you are a Dylan fan look for some of the older original performances and you will see what I am talking about. Don't waste your money on this one.",Negative
"Gertrude Lawrence was a funny funny person, who had a so so voice, but great charisma. Julie Andrews has nothing to brinbg to this role except a voice that is, as usual, thin, unexpressive, along with her dry white wine personality. No talent for the deeper roles ever, and this is a total surface performance, with Richard Crenna, in a huge role,  who used to be on TV as Walter Denton in Our Miss Brooks, with Eve Arden!The score is ruined by all in it, the script is excruciating,  and this film was, very soon after its release, cut to less than two hours and the title changed to Those Were The Happy Times. It was a major flop after The Sound of Music, and Robert Wise turned to the much better script, The Sand Pebbles, and made a major star out of Steve McQueen. Jule Andrews is best as Mary Poppins or as Millie in Thoroughlly Modern Millie..anything else impossible.Audrey Hepburn played Eliza Doolittle in My Fair Lady, dubbed no less, because George Cukor, the director, couldn't see any talent for the screen in Andrews. Hepburn was the better choice.Forgettable, and not camp..dull to the point of genius is the film ""Star.""Check out ""darling lili"" and see what Ms. Andrews does with that turkey. 25,000,000 loss.. more than Dr. Doolittle.Note too, that Joshua Logan would not consider Julie Andrews for ""Camelot."" He got Vanessa Redgrave.  Vanessa Redgrave should have done ""Star"" with Logan directing or Stanley Donen, co-starring Paul Newman.",Negative
"By 1968 Julie Andrews was one of the most-loved performers of stage and screen, the original Eliza Doolittle of Broadway's MY FAIR LADY, a Best Actress Oscar winner for MARY POPPINS, and the star of film version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC--a movie that was so profitable Hollywood wags dubbed it ""The Sound of Money.""  20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star, and (possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL, the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend: Gertrude Lawrence.It seemed like a winner.  Gertrude Lawrence (1902-1952) was known as ""The Toast of Two Continents"" in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning, and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career. Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise, the bio-pic STAR! seemed to have everything: lavish sets, incredible costumes, a truly great collection of songs, an epic running time, and--of course--Julie Andrews.  What more could you want?Well, an interesting movie would be nice.STAR! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco.  All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight, and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY TIMES.  As a result, the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.At the time, much of the film's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews.  Gertrude Lawrence, her remarkable career, and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968, and Julie Andrews simply did not look, walk, talk, sing, or in any way, shape or form bear any resemblance to her.  Seen today, however, this seems an unfair accusation; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence, and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her.  The real problem is the script, which goes nowhere at a slow crawl.  Indeed, the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence's financial bankruptcy!Yes, you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR!  But the story is beyond boring: it makes you feel that you're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello.  The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release; frankly, I can't see this as anything more than a mercy, for the less time spent here the better.  As for the bonuses, they are okay--which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself.  I'll be generous and give it two stars for production values and musical numbers.  But unless you are a diehard Julie Andrews fan, do yourself a favor and give STAR! a miss.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Negative
"This film should have it all, it's the story of a great show woman, close friends with the greatest of show men, Noel Coward.It had a large budget, a potentially great leading Lady, great costumes and a whole plethero of original Lawrence stage numbers, ""Poor Jenny"" is particularly striking. But somehow none of that is enough to either utilise Andrews to her full potential nor to tell the story of Gertrude Lawrence with the right amount of truth and razzmatazz.Andrews was largely blamed for it's failure at the time but this seems so wrong, essentially it is problem of script, Gertie's struggle with alcohol is only hinted at. Coward's homosexuality is completely glossed over and Gertie's illness and subsequent death at 50, from cancer, is not even eluded to!Here lies the problem I feel, how on earth can you set the screen alight with the story of a sensational life if you only tell the bits of the story you think the audience will tolerate?  You need to let the audience be the judge of what they can take and they clearly hated this! A shame and a wasted opportunity.",Negative
"Weather its a French Poodle or a mangy mutt. Star may be a French Poodle, but its still a dog. I dont understand all the raves for this film. Its easy to see why it tanked in 68 and I dont understand its cult following today. Yes, Julie (miscast), is beautiful, sings well, oodles of production numbers (way too many); the clothes! But where's the story? Star put the final nail in the coffin for road show pictures. A curiousity piece for those wondering what that era was like. But not a good example of it. Lawrence deserved better.",Negative
"Star! was a dismal flop when it was released and with good reason, it is a big, long, expensive bore! It drags, has little excitement, and even the magnificent Julie can't save it. The musical numbers are dull and the story plods along. Casting Julie Andrews as the late great British stage star Gertrude Lawrence, would seem to have been a stroke of brilliance, and perhaps, in a better written and directed production, it might have been wonderful, but it simply is not. The critics crucified the film, saving any praise for Julie's valiant attempt at injecting life into the lugubrious mess. But audiences stayed away. Even Darling Lili, which also flopped, had some fun and is entertaining. A real shame since Andrews and Lawrence should have been a perfect match for a musical bio.

"One would think it fairly difficult to go wrong with anything Gershwin, but not so.  This production of Porgy and Bess makes for disappointing viewing. The performers have great voices, but their voices are drowned out by tinny, loud orchestral music that sounds as if it were recorded in a metal box and then laid over the vocals. The instrumental music sounds totally disconnected from the vocals. It is so loud that much of the time the words being sung cannot be understood. The sound problems strongly detract from my overall enjoyment of the production.I also am disappointed with the unnecessary swearing in this production, as well as the fact that Porgy is on two feet, even if aided by canes. I will not give away the ending to those who are not familiar with Porgy and Bess, but this version does not end as other versions I am familiar with.None of these complaints are meant to detract from the quality of singing and acting, which is very good indeed. Marietta Simpson's portrayal of Maria is noteworthy as is Gregg Baker as Crown.",Negative

"I'm sorry to say this: THIS DVD SHOULD NEVER HAD BEEN RELEASED.If you notice they call it a videocassette in the inital copy warnings, twice... Video quality is pretyy much NTSC VHS.I'm a great fan of Sarah since 1973, when I heard her, at the Cascais Jazz festival, weeping and apologizing for a failure that occurred in the sound system, and own 13 LP's of her great art. All of them sound better that the Dolby crap on this DVD, including above all the ""Mono"" Mercury with Clifford Brown. The 1978 ""How Long has this been going on"" is a treasure..Sarah Vaughn is to be heard and to TO BE FELT. This DVD contains too little music, too much babbling, no PCM Audio, no Subtitles.It is pure exploitation and BMG should be ashamed of publishing it.If there is no better video/film footage of Sarah available anywhere, do no publish any video, leave us blind.  I'm only sorry for the earing impared, but what can I do?...",Negative
"Anybody that has been at, or perhaps should I say 'in', a santana concert certainly must remember it's the atmosphere that whafts around the stadium that perhaps increases the heartbeat rather than just the music. I was concerned when I bought this disc that Carlos may just be doing a 'sell out' or try to shove some non classic music down my throat.I was right, on both counts, sure he squeezed four of his best and clsssics into the middle of his concert with 'Black Magic W, Gypsy Queen, Oye Como Va', and  'Samba' while the rest of the disc is jam packed with 14 ho hummers .....In my mind the standard for classic super group DVD's still has to be Fleetwood Mack's 'The Dance' DVD ......You have to be a real hard core Santana fan and put up with his antics to enjoy this Santana DVD ......",Negative
"Dangerous was the project on which Michael Jackson began to lose sight of reality -- not just physical, but artistic grasp of reality.""Smooth Criminal"" is in my estimation the last great video he'd made, but even on that classic, you can see two incongruous personae emerging in Jackson's music-video approach.  The celebrated nightclub dance sequence is understandably considered a landmark in the art of music video, but if we jog our memory, we'd also remember there's a long, boring, glitzed-up, and utterly foolish sci-fi plot built up around that sequence.  (Joe Pesci as a drug villain and Michael Jackson the giant robot, anybody?)Well, on the videos from Dangerous, Jackson let his love of Steven Spielberg and fantasy filmmaking take over, and lost sight of the musician and performer.  There are some moments in these videos that are entertaining and remind us of vintage Michael Jackson videos, but these moments are never the centerpiece.  Eddie Murphy and ""Magic"" Johnson hamming it up delightfully in ""Remember the Time"", Naomi Campbell's sensuous writhe in ""In the Closet"", and the ripping hard-rock performance by Slash, Gilby Clarke and Muzz Skillings in ""Give In to Me"" are great -- but they are also always pushed to the back by other far less interesting elements.  The worst part is, there isn't a single video on here that uses Jackson's greatest visual gift, which is dance.  Not a single precision-choreographed dance sequence (as seen in ""Beat It"", ""Smooth Criminal"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad""...) among these videos, just utter chaos with fifty people each doing something different in the muddled, cacophonous dance ""scenes"" in ""Black or White"", ""Remember the Time"" and ""Jam"".  Was there even a choreographer?  And did s/he actually work with the director to figure out the moves and angles?  These videos pale alongside Janet Jackson's videos from Rhythm Nation:  1814, just a couple of years prior.Jackson also seems to acquire a kind of visual ADD in these videos, pulling together elements that don't mesh at all.  The intro to ""Black or White"", while amusing in a juvenile way, has nothing to do with the song; the special effects in ""Remember the Time"" look cheesy, and ""Jam"" is nothing but a bunch of amusing cameos (Heavy D, Michael Jordan, Kris Kross) and mashed-together shots with no method to the madness.  And let's not forget that utterly moronic ""panther"" ending to ""Black or White""...if the sequence actually had something to do with Jackson's message and the song, I believe the controversy over that segment might have been less pronounced.  Looking at it over a decade later, this sequence remains what it seemed, gratuitous destruction and lewd, aimless, undisciplined dance moves aimed to shock, and with no narrative, musical or thematic context whatsoever.The only self-contained and coherent videos here are ""Who Is It"" and ""Give In to Me"".  The former, though opaque in its imagery, at least achieves stylistic unity, while the latter is a straight-ahead rock performance video.  Poor editing spoiled its rock-out impact, though -- it makes you yearn for ""Dirty Diana"".  And in the end, the only lasting moment of transcendence here, and the only piece up to the par of Jackson's Thriller and Bad videos, is the famous ""morphing"" sequence in ""Black or White"".  It's visually attractive, fun, and helps get across the message of the song.  Something most of these videos fail to do; it's little wonder that Jackson's later DVD collections tend to include very few of the Dangerous videos.  They really are the nadir of his music-video oeuvre.And after having bought four Michael Jackson music-video DVDs (not even counting the concert DVD that came with the Ultimate Collection boxed set, and my old VHS copies of Moonwalker and The Legend Continues), I'm compelled to slam those fascistic ""Brace Yourself"" intros that Jackson always slaps at the beginning of his video collections.  Wagner-sized vocal chants, marching death squads, and hysterical masses?  Who does that remind us of?  That same megalomania, which makes Jackson constantly bombard us with messages of how great he is, is what had eventually sunk his music and videos to such pathetic levels as we've seen in the last 10 years.  He never rediscovered the joy of music as we'd heard on Off the Wall and Thriller, and with the way his career is going now, it's not likely we ever will again.",Negative
"If you want a great live Iron Maiden video, I suggest you get Maiden England or Live After Death (if you can find it).

"It's entirely possible that Quag got a bum copy of this thing, but if this is how the disc is intended to look and sound then it's just one more addition to McCartney's catalogue of AWFUL concert films.  Lousy picture aside - I remember the videotape looking superior to this mess - there are enough audio drop-outs here to suggest this was made by bootleggers, not highly-paid professionals.  An utter waste that suggests McCartney no longer gives a whiff about the product bearing his name.",Negative
"This DVD, the first time you put it in the player, will stink of bad production and really weird editing. Plus, if you know too much about this particular tour you will drive yourself nuts noticing songs out of order. But that said, it gets better after you've watched it a few times.The live versions of Beatle hits are great - this tour featured Drive My Car's only live outing to date. It's also nice to see Magical Mystery Tour and Lady Madonna - Macca's 88-93 band gave these songs a great rendition.The bad news starts when you get past those songs, though. Let Me Roll It is very boring with this band. The organ is way too low in the mix on the organ solo...that doesn't help. Plus nothing will ever compare to the blistering version found on Back in the U.S. / World .The tracks from Off the Ground aren't all that bad, there are five of them on the DVD, and 3 of them are good (Lookin for Changes, Hope of Deliverance, and C'mon People). Peace in the Neighborhood and Biker Like an Icon are songs that have grown on *me*, but I don't guarantee it will do the same for you.Oh, and as a...um...&quot;bonus&quot;, we get additional versions of Let it Be, Yesterday, and Hey Jude. Let it Be would be good except that the director chose to include the only time Robbie gave a bad LiB guitar solo. Bleech. Yesterday is it's usual self, good, but I've heard it so many times by this point. And Hey Jude is my pic for worst track on the disc...there's just no energy.An alright DVD, I still watch it occaisionally, but when it's bad, it's really bad.",Negative
"Ah, another Rankin-Bass film goes to the butcher shop!  The problems remain the same.  What are they doing with the soundtracks to these films?  How can they possibly screw them up in this way?  And how can they do this over and over AND OVER?  To make this mistake once as a quick way to make a quick buck during all the hype over LOTR made sense, but here's a film that no one is going to buy unless they are already a fan.  Why give it the same lousy treatment?In fact, if they were in such a rush, why not just somehow duplicate the german DVD?  It seems like it would actually have been MORE work to do the terrible job they did.And like The Hobbit, what really blows my mind is the lowsy artwork.  The hobbit in particular had fantastic cover artwork, etc. thanks to the magnificient talent of Topcraft (that would go on to become studio ghibli, surprise!), but instead it got a truly bad cover (don't worry, they're busy doing the same sort of facelift to all the children books you grew up loving too!).  The last Unicorn suffers the same exact fate.  Due to Amazon being a global store, you can just go to the bottom of the page, click on germany and type Last Unicorn right into the search engine.  When you see how great that cover looks, you'll never want to look at this one again.I really don't understand what gives.  During the mid 70's through the very early 80's, some strange, and even intelligent animation was coming out--animation that was more literate and less song and dance.  Anyone remember the Mouse and his Child animated film?  I never expected to see any of this stuff come out on DVD because of the very small audience for it, but it seems if you wait long enough, all things will come back into print.  Just don't expect any love to be put into it.",Negative
"First things first: This is a nice movie for kids, particularly little girls. The story is compelling, though the animation is pretty lousy. The music, written by the estimable Jimmy Webb and sung by America, is quite good. I'd give the movie 3 stars on the whole, 4 stars for a little girl.Now for this particular DVD. It's absolutely attrocious! The picture looks no better than an average VHS cassette. Worse (MUCH worse), the soundtrack suffers from noticable pitch inconsistencies. It sounds like a dub from a BAD cassette tape. There is no excuse for this, and I've never seen (or heard) a poorer DVD transfer.If you already own this movie on VHS, there's no reason to spend any money to get his version. It's surely no better than the copy you have, and is (because of the soundtrack wow and flutter) arguably worse.",Negative
"The original run time for this movie is 92 minutes, but this 25th anniversary version is 89 minutes, yet no scenes are cut. How can this be? Simply, the movie has been ""sped up"" by 4%, which is what happens when movies are put on video in Europe due the difference in frame rate. It looks like what the geniuses who released this DVD did was, take the 4% faster overseas version (meaning the audio pitch is higher), and simply use that without first trying to ""reconvert"" it back to our system to get the correct time/speed. But wait, this is equally lame, we shouldn't need to convert from a previously converted format, as the U.S. format ""is"" the original format.Bottom line, this release is not any kind of remaster, it was simply stolen from a European release that wasn't even that good. The best quality DVD version ever released for this movie (to date of this review) was the German release, the quality will blow you away. The only drawbacks for viewing in the U.S. is, you would need a multi-format DVD player for playback (though your PC drive will work), and, you would have the 4% speed hike. Most people won't notice the speed increase, but in music it is more noticeable.Get the German DVD if you can, it has both 2.0 and 5.1 audio, and pristine video quality in true widescreen. And it has the originally UNEDITED audio. Wonder if Lion's Gate will actually do it right for the Blu-Ray release.***** AMENDED FOR BLU-RAY REVIEW, READ BELOW:DO NOT waste your money on the U.S. blu-ray release, Lionsgate dropped the ball again, the quality is awful: colors are faded, and there is so much grain it makes no sense....the good news is, the German blu-ray on the Concorde label looks like it was made yesterday, and that is no exaggeration...the colors will blow you away, but even better is the clarity and detail, it's jaw dropping, even the background forest scenes are razor sharp. AND THERE IS NO GRAIN. And, Blu-ray high definiton video doesn't have the 4% speed issues that standard definiton DVD's have. Also, The German Blu-ray is region free, so it will play on U.S Blu-ray players, except for the extras, which will not play at all as they are standard defintion.Below are the links for the German Blu-ray, and the German 3D version of the Blu-ray; to help navigate through the german language, I found it helpful to match the pages with same U.S. amazon pages to see what options I needed to use to buy it:http://www.amazon.de/letzte-Einhorn-Blu-ray-Arthur-Rankin/dp/B005FUO7D6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1364742928&sr;=8-3http://www.amazon.de/Einhorn-Version-magnetischem-3D-Wackelbild-Blu-ray/dp/B0094M6DTC/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid;=1364742928&sr;=8-5",Negative
"The Last Unicorn is one of my favorite animated films of all time and I have waited years for this movie to be released on DVD.  The soundtrack is wonderful too, and I listen to it often.  You can imagine how excited I was when I got the Amazon notification that it would finally be available, so the movie itself gets 5 stars but this edition gets 1 star and deserves nothing more.  This has to be the absolute worse picture quality I have ever seen on a DVD...heck the VHS copy has to be better than this.  The sound quality is terrible too, sounding almost like a record, and there are absolutely no extras.  Not to mention that the movie was only released in full screen, but I could have dealt with that had the rest of the DVD been done right.  Artisan/FHE did such a shoddy job with this DVD that I will be very careful when picking up anything else from them in the future.  I tried to return my copy, but of course since the seal was broken, they could do nothing about it so I resold it online and have ordered a no region copy of the German release, which looks and sounds great!  I recommend anyone wanting this movie to consider that for themselves.  Maybe Artisan/FHE will take the hint and actually give us some credit by releasing a version of The Last Unicorn worth paying for.",Negative
"Well, unlike the people that read the reviews about ""horrible quality"" and bought it anyways, I'm here because of the horrible quality lol. I got this DVD in through netflix and it did indeed look awful. However, the DVD was quite scratched so I thought maybe... just maybe... because it was such consistent scratching over the whole DVD, it was just that and I'd get a newer copy. So, here I am after a google search for ""last unicorn"" AND ""poor quality"" AND DVD. So, apparantly it just does suck that bad lol. Oh well.Anyways, believe it. I thought I was watching a worn out VHS copy of the film. Poor indeed. A crying shame :(",Negative
"The Last Unicorn may be my favorite movie to date and I was so excited to hear that it was finally announced in the US. Finally I would own The Last Unicorn a classic piece of animation in digital quality! However Little did I know that the production company would put all of 2 dollars into the dvd release of this major film. First off it is only in Standard that is right the film has been cut from it's original widescreen (which is how the laserdisc was presented) to a formatted to fit your tv mode. You can notice this most when mommy fortuna's wagon passes by and half of the words are cut off from the picture. Secondly the digital transfer is AWFUL! if I didn't know better they copied the VHS master onto DVD. the Colors are all blah and the animation is lost. This mystifies me because I also own the German widescreen version (which is incredible!!) and their transfer is flawless and crisp! third, did someone forget the special features on this disc?! Play Movie or scene selection. that is it!. Lastly this movie has The worst Box art EVER! and it doesn't stop there the art is also on the disc and the interactive menus (which play some god awful made for dvd elevator music!) This release of an amazing movie is a crime! Artisan (the company) should really rethink this and release a new transfer special edition. but that will never happen.",Negative

"This is a very good film that has yet had a decent video release here in the US.  This DVD release is a disaster.This particular print has several major defects.  First this movie suffers more than most when cutting it from widescreen to full screen.  But the pan-and-scan job (the technique used to make a widescreen film fit on a regular television) was also totally botched leaving many scenes showing only half a face or character.There is also many color problems.  The print is biased to red.  Dark scenes, of which there are many, show a red tint.  Related to this is that the greens are subdued.  Many objects that should be green show as blue.The print is also grainy showing more video noise than normal.The soundtrack is extremely harsh sounding making it dificult to listen to.I'd recommend you seek out the widescreen version which has none of these problems.",Negative

"As a fan, I always appreciate whatever is out there, but as a fan, too, this is not a very good concert.A much better one is this: Temptations in Hamburg, 1976.  I have it on DVD.  I guess it is bootlegged, because I have never seen it for sale anywhere.  The concert was cut for length and shown on German TV, 45 minutes total.The show is great: over half of their last great album (""A Song For You"") and their last GREAT tenor (Glenn Leonard) and their last year with Dennis from his first stay with the group.  It is the end of an era with the Tempts and with R&B; singing overall, as disco and white rock dominate to excess.  Dennis sings ""Memories"" near then end and I can just hear him also saying his actual goodbyes to the group and fans as well.  The group is very jumpy and disco-y, but they still have that magical precision and class.  Otis even sings well - twice!  And the cutaways to the ""beautiful"" German girls are hilarious - they are all horses.  Only one dude in the whole audience was moving to the music.  But they did clap a lot!If you take this as a bookend to the 1973 Live in Japan CD, you have a wonderful view of their last great years.  Everything in this concert is right, and it is truly the end.Folks - THIS is what you want to be seeing.",Negative

"Elvis Presley's 68 Comeback Special is a poor concert. Many songs are turned into medley's(who only wants to hear a partial song?). Also Elvis's performance just isn't anygood, and the setlist leaves a lot to be desired. Not enough big hits, and I hate the gospel medley, awful!",Negative
This is highway robbery! The original show was lame for it's time and NBC (or whoever) is charging WAY TOO MUCH for this set. Do you want to see Elvis the right way? Buy the deluxe version of Elvis Aloha From Hawaii (money is much better spent for quality and quanity). Pass on this one!,Negative
"OK, let's get this out of the way, the ELVIS ('68 Comeback) is the finest TV special ever presented on American television. So why the 1 star? The editing in this version of the show is appalling, such lazy dilettantes. Every time there is a cut from one scene to another there is a still shot that moves from left to right and then the action resumes. It is grating. The show cuts from sit down performance to stand up and back and forth, all edits being telegraphed with the aforementioned still shot, stop and go routine, it is a real hack job.I own the 74 minute version put out 15 years ago and the editing follows the original broadcast. When they can, they put in extra footage at the appropriate time (sit down is added to sit down performance, standup to standup so there is a continuous flow). The edits can be made from scene to scene and the original fade to black for the commercials are maintained. In addition they edited out Blue Christmas for crying out loud, what's up with that? Also on the cutting room floor is the little funky rhythm guitar part that immediately follows the intro Guitar Man and the audience clapping, hey remember the part where Elvis gives that sly smile and says, ""I think I'll put a strap on this and stand up""? , remember his deadpan delivery of ""Man I just work here"" , Good thing for your memory `cause it's gone, cut out in favor of those imaginative edits.For the record to edit from scene to scene, if the action can't be done smoothly, you can always insert an audience shot and then back to Elvis, it's called `editing',people. The picture and sound are otherwise fabulous, it looks the same as the BOX set that I also own, I was hoping to get a version of the performance with extra black leather footage, but I was assuming the editing would be handled by professionals who would try to maintain the spirit, look,  and vitality of the original while adding to the show. They ended up subtracting from the overall viewing pleasure. By editing out the Elvis dialog, they've removed the soul of the presentation, the special was all about getting Elvis back in front of a live microphone but also to humanize him, show his gifted sense of humor. What a drag.",Negative

"I'm giving this Dvd only 2.5 stars because you have to be a die-hard Cranberries fan to avoid falling asleep during this snoozefest. It's like watching a high school band perform in the gymnasium. They use either red, blue, or green lighting to try to liven it up a bit, but it fails miserably. Mostly boring and lifeless--more dead, than live, this concert is dark, dreary and dull (partly due to the song selection)!It's in widescreen (looks like, 1.66:1), and the 2.0 channel stereo is very weak and useless. Luckily, the 5.1 surround is enough of an improvement (though still much too weak and well below average) to keep this from being a complete waste of time. Still, even my favorite song, ""Dreams"", failed to lift my spirits. Having the audience try to sing along, certainly didn't help matters. Ironically, Delores sings ""Zombie"" with more passion than any of the other songs. Here, she is not in a zombie, or out of breath state, but instead, more focused and strong. To spice things up, they even added in some quick edits during the song to match the beat of the music, and you can even see a man being passed around on the fingertips of the audience members as well. This performance awoke me from my zombie state, and without it, I would have lowered my rating to only 2 stars (even though it stood out only because the rest of the concert was so bland).Unfortunately, I found almost all of the other songs to be too dull, regardless of how well Delores sang them. Other songs, such as: Pretty, Dreams, and Linger are done much better on their Cd's.The picture gallery includes twenty useless pictures. The jukebox feature allows you to play any of the 15 concert songs in any order. However, even that is badly done. The wait between each song change is an extra few seconds too long. Other concert Dvd's with the jukebox feature (Jewel, etc.), make the song transitions faster, and appear almost seemless.The 15 included songs from this 1994 London concert are: Pretty, Dreaming My Dreams, Linger, Ridiculous Thoughts, Daffodils Lament, How, Everything I Said, Not Sorry, Waltzing Back, Dreams, Zombie, Liar, So Cold in Ireland, Empty, Still Cant...I've seen worse, but this certainly isn't going to do much for adding new fans.

"I finished watching THE SECRET OF NIMH. Don't worry: their secret is safe with me. By the end of the movie, I still had no idea what NIMH is. I assume it's some nasty lab that does nasty things to rats to make them intelligent. But they also seem to be exterminators. And unless I dozed off and missed it, they never explained what the letters N.I.M.H. stand for. They're written in upper-case letters, so probably they stand for something.The only characters I found remotely interesting were the owl, the cat and the crow. (I did like the kid calling the crow a turkey; that was cute.) It was a delight to hear John Carradine's voice again. He must have been at death's door when that was made. Dom DeLuise was fun. Elizabeth Hartman, whoever she is, had no personality whatsoever. She came across as a total wimp. Just at the point where she might have developed into someone interesting, the movie ended very abruptly with the two crows forming patterns in the sky with their string. Huh? Did they run out of film at that point? Or money?Anyway, the watercolor backgrounds were pretty.There are many things in the movie that I though were unsuitable for kids, and the pacing is so slow and meandering that I can't imagine kids being interested.

"I was so excited to see this performance coming to DVD. It is one of only a few titles left in my Laserdisc collection -- titles I have kept on LD (along with the player!) awaiting their release on DVD because they are absolute must-have discs.Peter Gabriel and Robert LePage collaborated to stage this show, and everything from the elaborate dual-ended stage-in-the-round with lifts and moving sections to the mobile video projection screens to the gorgeous lighting design is first-rate.The show is a visual tour de force, and yet this serves to augment rather than distract from the wonderful music. As a bassist myself, I always love to see and hear Tony Levin play, and this video is no disappointment in that regard. The same can be said for drummer/percussionist Manu Katche, whose rock-solid time anchors the band while his fills and ornamentation will leave you speechless.I could go on and on, but the crux is simple: this had potential to be a must-have DVD.  Sadly, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I wrote the glowing stuff above based upon the Laserdisc version, which I own, anticipating that the DVD would only improve upon it.

"The actual concert is the BEST...but the so-called remastered DVD is the worst!  Instead of heeding to the negative reviews, I decided to view it with my own eyes because it's truly one of the best concerts ever.  But I ended up returning the DVD and purchased it on VHS with the &#34;original&#34; 1994 release date because the &#34;SOUND&#34; quality was so much better and I didn't loose ALL the artistic visual elements with the &#34;fake&#34; widescreen format!!!  The remastered version is not worth your money!  Peter Gabriel should care more about reproducing this masterpiece and take another stab at it because this DVD release is absolutely horrendous!  The VHS copy (even though it's mildly smokey looking) is still much better in my opinion - largely because the sound quality is dramatically better in VHS!  The remastered DVD's sound was actually more muffled and flat throughout the performance - and let's face it, music concerts are FIRST about sound!  So all together, this DVD is a huge disappointment.  I recommend searching out a copy on VHS (sadly).",Negative
She seems to be into herself more than the music. All the songs sounded the same in my opinion. The sound quality was good but the picture was not.,Negative
"OK, yeah, it's great to see the Stones in the studio working on what would become (almost) their ""signature tune"" for awhile.  But this Godard mushwit...I mean, doggone it, by the time ""Sympathy"" (the movie, now) was released, the (giggle) ""revolution"" concept was just so very trite, passe and O-V-E-R.  Still: seeing this... is this ""thing"" supposed to make you want to rush right out and roll some bandages for ""the revolution?""  Oh, give me a break.....",Negative
"I have to admit, that both Gimme Shelter and the Rolling Stones Bridges to Babylon Tour Live in Concert '97-'98 DVD rate high for me. These two are classics that give us great performances by the Rolling Stones. Easy to follow, entertaining; and in the case of Gimme Shelter, thought provoking.What happened here? I originally bought the VHS version back in 1994 during the Stones hype of Voodoo Lounge. I do not have the DVD version. I do not want it. This is perhaps one of the worst films out there.Don't get me wrong. I love the Stones footage of rehearsing the song. I can even see that the director may have been trying an avant garde film (or avant garde a clue, as the late George Harrison once remarked). Just because this is the Stones or ""avant garde"", does not make it any better.Disjointed scenes of interviewing one woman about love, the black revolutionaries scene, and other hodgepodge of stuff make this unwatchable. C'mon. Give me a break. If I am watching Stones I want performance, interviews, or insight from the band themselves. I would have given this movie 1/2 a star(if I could have on Amazon) for at least seeing the Stones in part of it. I always like to give the benefit of the doubt to any artist that I like.  In this case, avoid this ""movie"" at all costs.",Negative
"just got this, the stones are great, the rest sucks....I can't even make to the end, my wife just laughs at me every time I put it in to try to see the end. sorry it sucks........",Negative
"I am a huge fan of the late 60s and early 70s era Stones. I bought this DVD without knowing anything about the French director Jean-Luc Godard. The so called &quot;pop politiacal cartoons&quot; that the review on the back cover refers to as sheer genius, are moronic and actually painful to watch. These skits are all about socialism, black power, and revolution. Oh boy! The high minded symbolism of this movie just looks ridiculous to me. The skits in this movie are so un-professional that they appear to be made by Junior High School kids! And that is a slight to the kids! As far as the Stones rehersals, they are interesting, but slow. They develop only the one song. As great as that song is (one of my all time favorite Stones tunes) it's just not something to watch over and over again. Especially if you have to endure the rest of this horrible movie.",Negative
"Great song; ridiculous movie.I'm of this silly generation, yet it is not the silliness of half this movie which bothers me. (The movie mixes footage of the Rolling Stones recording ""Sympathy For the Devil"" with immature, amateur social ""commentary"".)It is the arrogance and the ignorance which flows from this film that bothers me, the fakery that richness and idleness birth. Silly me! When I was impressionable, I listened to these jesters and these jumping jack flashes rather than the wisdom of the west.Maybe this is why so many had so many objections to us in the 1970s; we were so objectionable.Continue to listen to the song. Save yourself, though, from this dull, pornographic drivel. (Unless, of course, you want to see just how ugly and empty we were then.)",Negative
"What a package! The making-of, the background, the whole process of putting together one incredible Stones tune, ""Sympathy for the Devil"". Plus, the avante-garde use of Eldridge Cleaver's book, ""Soul On Ice""--what a psychedelic touch.....Totally win-win!",Negative
"The DVD quality of the DCD concert in 1993 is well below the VHS Quality, Goodness WHY? I have been a collector of everything DCD have produced, How could Brendon and Lisa let something of this poor quality get released by the DistributorsStill DCD are or  were a terrific band of musicians. Lets hope this DVD will get remastered",Negative
"Very disapointed. Couldn't even watch the whole thing. Led Z moves me, this tapes left me cold.",Negative
"Just because it is Paige and Plant, you cannot give it 5 stars. This DVD is horrible. Until around the last few songs, where thanks to the orchestra and semi decent drummer, they pull off a few good numbers. Kashmir is the highlight of the dvd, nice and long, orchestra meshes really well with the song, and plant is least annoying in it.The dvd starts off in the wrong track. What the hell are Paige and Plant doin with a guitar and mic in the middle of a forest? Is this some kind of a joke? Then there is an absolutely ear bleeding, annoying version of Battle of Evermore with one of the worst backup singers I have ever heard. Someone should just staple her mouth before any more ppl go deaf.And whats with the tempo of when the levee breaks, they play it like a punk rock song instead of a classic rock n roll song.  And all of a sudden, they are sitting with some dudes in the middle of some middle eastern city, playing with local instruments, its just not there...theres no life, its just lame to see plant acting like he is all into their music n stuff.I dont know what they were trying to pull with this DVD, I had a completely different picture in mind when I bought it. Kashmir kinda comforted me a bit, but it is still just worthy of a rental and no more.",Negative
"I feel that Aerosmith lost some of it's edge in the 90's. I was not a fan of ""Get A Grip"", and I haven't given a chance for ""Nine Lives"". I hate half the songs on here like ""Crying"", ""Crazy"", ""Blind Man"", ""Janie's Got A Gun"". I feel that this was a flake off to Geffen records as they weren't able to get a lucrative deal out of them. I found the songs from ""Permanent Vacation"" that are represented here are the best songs on the album, and ""Living On The Edge"" is just o.k. Otherwise this is a poor excuse for a greatest hits compilation.",Negative
"Awful CD. Aerosmith are one of the most overplayed and overratedrock bands of all time behind the even worse, AC/DC. The singerjust screams, this isn't music, this is just noise. I mean theonly good song is Janie's Got a Gun, everyelse spit. This musicis trash, throw it away and don't buy it again.Get Your Wings is all you need from this overrated band.",Negative
"This disaster epitomizes all that is wrong with corporate sellout rock music.  Aerosmith is responsible for some of the greatest rock of the 70s, but here they hired some professional writers and set a torch to their storied legacy.  Crazy, Amazing, Crying, Blind Man - each is rewrite of the other and they all belong on a Cher album.  Seriously.  They have nothing to do with rock n roll.  Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period (FINE, Young Lust, The Other Side, geez I'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad), but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum.  Man, even the cover looks like it was whipped together in 3 minutes.  And come on - how stupid is the title?  ""Big Ones, get it?  Har har har"".  Hey, if you know these songs and you love 'em, then more power to you and have fun with this album.  Anyone else who wants to expereince the real Aerosmith should start with Rocks.  Aerosmith: No shame.",Negative
They look good and stick good! I just don't like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just won't buy a product like this again,Positive
These stickers work like the review says they do. They stick on great and they stay on the phone. They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister. :),Positive
These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT! ONE YEAR!! Great quality!,Positive
"Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal, it would've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.",Positive
"awesome! stays on, and looks great. can be used on multiple apple products.  especially having nails, it helps to have an elevated key.",Positive
Came just as described.. It doesn't come unstuck and its cute! People ask where I got them from & it's great when driving.,Positive
"Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm. I'm glad that it lasts from start to end. 5/5",Positive
"This is a fantastic case. Very stylish and protects my phone. Easy access to all buttons and features, without any loss of phone reception. But most importantly, it double power, just as promised. Great buy",Positive
this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I can't complain! a+ recommend it to all,Positive
"This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4. The S4 fits very well, is slim and doesn't add much weight to the Galaxy S4. It doubles the battery life. You can charge either the battery, the phone or both. There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well. Well worth the price.",Positive
"Performs exactly as advertised . It's very  sturdily built,and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it's supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience. Don't know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it.",Positive
"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It doesn't heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I couldn't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can't even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology won't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they don't know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I've made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Positive
"Just what I needed. I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons, but I also needed new replacement batteries. Now this isn't the case, since I got both in one. Awesome thanks A+",Positive
"When there is no outlets, or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue! Ordered one for my husband, and myself. Great purchase!!",Positive
"It works great. Doesn't heat up like crazy like the other ones I got, and cheaper too! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get, thats why I got one for me and my wife. I wonder why its called power bear..",Positive
"Surprisingly, this inexpensive version works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive variety. It has been working for me for months now. No problem. Excellent value.",Positive
"I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.",Positive
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it.,Positive
"just what you need, I am always having to charge my phone and then find I have another item to charge also.",Positive
"They are nothing special for sure, but it's nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it.  able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice.",Positive
"I have several chargers. Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products.",Positive
I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review.,Positive
"This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.",Positive
Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion. And the item is just as described. Great buy if you ask me,Positive
"This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru's console.  Passengers love it, I love it because it emits a blue glow, because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new.",Positive
"I've bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most wouldn't stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT!",Positive
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone,Positive
"It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job",Positive
"excellent product, works great , have easy handling, and good quality as it is announced. reached as is shown time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything",Positive
Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling,Positive
great charger for 2 devices and i haven't had any problems so far 3yrs now,Positive
Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%,Positive
"I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it's cheap, small and compact",Positive
Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too.,Positive
"works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger.",Positive
"This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great value and easy on the wallet.",Positive
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go!,Positive
"I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once!  Seems to charge quicker without GPS on, with it on, it only holds the battery, but better than it dying!!!",Positive
Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port.  Works.,Positive
I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price,Positive
"I have several of these, from various retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They're great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn't expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don't last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.",Positive
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer,Positive
"I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a very good deal.",Positive
I love this case! It's so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy!,Positive
"I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The ""rubberized"" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all'd), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!",Positive
Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks,Positive
"The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.",Positive
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can't believe the mark up on these things!,Positive
This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend,Positive
"Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a ""good look"" for their phone.",Positive
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,Positive
"The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.",Positive
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.,Positive
The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent.,Positive
This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,Positive
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot.,Positive
Its rubberized doesn't look like it in the picture but it is It's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.,Positive
"Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.",Positive
This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone.  It is very stylish and I received many compliments,Positive
"This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!!",Positive
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,Positive
"very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!",Positive
"This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised. It is a genuine Blackberry charger. It was brand new and worked perfectly. For the price, I don't think you can ask for much more than that!",Positive
Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger.,Positive
"Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it doesn't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.",Positive
"I've had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries.",Positive
"so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.",Positive
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,Positive
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a  very affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it.,Positive
Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2.,Positive
"I needed a charger quick and I didn't want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I don't have to struggle to see my phone when I'm laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter doesn't like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this!",Positive
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.,Positive
"This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!",Positive
I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4.,Positive
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,Positive
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!,Positive
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it.,Positive
"I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Can't go wrong with the price and certainly can't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!).",Positive
I bought this for my Samsung Charge. It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger. I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!,Positive
"It does what it needs to do, very pleased. I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back.",Positive
"Charger works great. Haven't had any issues with it at all. I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I've used, but other than that, I love it.",Positive
"The big store that is in every town now (can't say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.",Positive
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot.,Positive
luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them,Positive
"A very good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger.",Positive
Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item.  This is OEM and not third party after market. Bought two.  Work great,Positive
This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain.,Positive
"Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers. This thing works good, but its not all fireworks and hotel parties. Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it.",Positive
I used this charger for a couple of months now. Its a very good charger. It charges my phone very quickly.,Positive
It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone,Positive
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price.,Positive
"good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product",Positive
This charger works perfectly.  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine. I highly recommend it.,Positive
"I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past.",Positive
Hope to use it soon.  My other one worked sometimes.  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging.,Positive
"es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema",Positive
"I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome.",Positive
"I've been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended.  I would buy again.  Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length.",Positive
Works great nice long cord. Does the trick. Bought several of these to put in diff. rooms & one for work.,Positive
Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection. Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it.,Positive
"fast delivery, works well. Not very long.",Positive
This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone.,Positive
it's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping wasn't more than the item. I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone. but great all an all,Positive
"although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful.  it is longer than what is given with the phone.  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical",Positive
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!,Positive
"works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price",Positive
I haven't had any problems with it.  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2.,Positive
thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc...,Positive
I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work.,Positive
I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger.,Positive
charges me up all the way. doubles my battery liek promised. case protects well and the color is awesome nice,Positive
"The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it. They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish. Matches my 5C PERFECTLY :)",Positive
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery. I am charged for the full day with this case.,Positive
"Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone . Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear . Really like the name of the case as well !! 5 stars deff !",Positive
This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying. Plus the color is very beautiful.,Positive
Bought one for me and another for the wife. Acts as phone protector and charging case in one. Hold charge all day so no complaints.,Positive
"This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable. I also love the glossy texture of the case. Highly recommend!!",Positive
"This is a very well built and designed case,with a very cool and attractive color. Phone dies too quickly without it",Positive
"I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it. It is hard to get off",Positive
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it.,Positive
"Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would.",Positive
"this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too",Positive
"Really cute but the heart doesn't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend.",Positive
Great case for my phone. Protects and keeps me charged. easy access to the button and sounds good too. i like it,Positive
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening.,Positive
"Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister's is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I'm just concerned about the functionality).",Positive
Great case. Doubled my battery life like promised. Can't beat the price. I would recommend it for a friend. A+,Positive
"Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more. I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY.",Positive
"Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol.). Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can't always plug in to charge each day.",Positive
"I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS",Positive
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying. the phone is great for entertainment. but battery could be better. the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment. im sold,Positive
This product is great. I like the kickstand on the back. The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status.,Positive
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price. I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper.,Positive
"This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++",Positive
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping. Came in different colors to match phone.  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long. No complaints or problems. (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up),Positive
"Since I am always on my phone, the battery life is very short. After purchasing this battery case I am no longer worried about running out of battery life.",Positive
"My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look, fits well, doesn't get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed!",Positive
The color pops out so well. Clips well to my phone and charges me up. I cant complain! No cons!,Positive
The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic,Positive
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised,Positive
The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy.,Positive
"Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days. BRAVO!",Positive
"I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected. He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing. This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it doesn't add to much weight",Positive
"This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours.",Positive
"I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It's a life saver, and there isn't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend.",Positive
compre este Case hace varios meses y protege el celular de manera excelente..ni siquiera tube que comprar protector de pantalla y gracias a dios mi cel este nuevo..,Positive
I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t version). The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35. I just can't justify spending that much on a case. This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2. The size is the same. The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked. I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine,Positive
"nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas. good buy for the price",Positive
"Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You've been warned.",Positive
"I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there. Very Good purchase.",Positive
"Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it doesn't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber.  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky.",Positive
This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it.It is a high quality skin and gives a very good feeling in your hands.I recommend this product for your SGSII.,Positive
I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick. Lightweight and sleek.,Positive
I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch. My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars. Well for the price i think it is ok.,Positive
Don't expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Din't Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone.,Positive
Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1.,Positive
"arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone .",Positive
"It is good, and look so cute. I like it. It is cheap than when i saw in a store.",Positive
"I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its very safe, & not to bulky! Overall very satisfied customer.",Positive
Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) virtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case.,Positive
"totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new!",Positive
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust.,Positive
"This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints.",Positive
"Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC",Positive
this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable. . .,Positive
"Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a very well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again.",Positive
"I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one. Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is.No complain.",Positive
"There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports.",Positive
this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer. great value for the price.,Positive
"This cable is better than original.  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC.",Positive
"I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!",Positive
"A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40"") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car.",Positive
"The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price.",Positive
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly.  I'm glad I bought it.  Thank you!,Positive
"This charger does the trick.  The charger in my car doesn't work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby.  I may charge it every couple of weeks.  Very convenient accessory.",Positive
"The Motorola T505 doesn't come with an AC charger, only a DC charger. This makes a great addition to the package. You can charge in your home at night.",Positive
"I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems.",Positive
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time.,Positive
"It's true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it's chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I'm thinking about getting a 2nd one!",Positive
"This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I haven't tested it's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that's all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long.",Positive
"I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive.",Positive
"I'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just don't get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it didn't work, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!",Positive
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great. Doesn't charge super fast but charges it none the less.,Positive
this product is great value for the price. and it works like it suppose to. you can't beat it. you always need extra cords.,Positive
It is what it is. A charging and sync cord. It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer.,Positive
works great. it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one.,Positive
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer.  Works well and fits my needs and expectations.,Positive
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks,Positive
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far,Positive
"It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire?",Positive
do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that.,Positive
It Works perfect. It charges my phone pretty quickly and it's great that it retracts. No problems with this charger.,Positive
"This is an excellent divice, I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine. Love it!",Positive
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it's not necessary.  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated. The cord retracts in a snap when I'm done with it. It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere. I recommend it!,Positive
"love it for moving from car to car.  great for a mobile person. can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping.",Positive
I've used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke. But I can still used it. The button that retracts it just got loose so it doesn't latch anymore.,Positive
"took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger. the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone. down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha.",Positive
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews. Price was great so I bought extras just in case. Quality seems great. Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments. Love not having the cords getting tangled in car,Positive
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely. I does the job just as well as a thick corded device. excellent product.,Positive
"This works just fine to recharge my Captivate. With some products, it's impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem.",Positive
"Item shipped and arrived very fast. Item is perfect for my car & phone, very compact. Item is as advertise.",Positive
Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it.,Positive
"Not much to say, here.  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store.",Positive
This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house. I use it frequently.,Positive
"I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago, but this one is great.",Positive
It works great. It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone. I would recommend this item.,Positive
"This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone. By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.",Positive
we've had it a month and it's working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with the phone.,Positive
"it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount",Positive
"Thanks for the quick delivery time. And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome!",Positive
I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks!,Positive
"Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living wouldn't that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!",Positive
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short. Works well. Charges phone quickly also. Wouldn't buy again however.,Positive
Its a charger and it works as advertised. It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well.,Positive
"U can never have too many.  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work.  Now I don't have to worry about forgetting it.",Positive
Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed. Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do.,Positive
Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it.....Great job...Would highly recommend this product to all customers.Thank you,Positive
"Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel...driving.If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy.  I just wish the length of the cord were longer....I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me....!",Positive
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months. So far all is well. Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button.,Positive
"I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage, it works on both really well.",Positive
works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use,Positive
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;",Positive
"I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.",Positive
"I've been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I don't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through.",Positive
"Love this type of headset.  I use one at work every day, so I got one for home too.  I hate things &#34;in&#34; my ear, so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation.  Comfortable and lightweight.  Doesn't even mess up hair.  It includes a leatherette &#34;cup&#34; for the ear speaker, but I usually don't even use it, finding it comfortable even without it.  It converts to an &#34;ear hook&#34; type also, but I don't find that very useful.  The inline volume control and mute is nice, although a bit large and heavy.  Great sound quality",Positive
"I bought this for its durability, but the sound quality was pretty low/poor; volume was low too.",Positive
"This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality (i.e. very good). The 2.5mm jack means it won't fit on some mobile phones (this is smaller than a standard headphone jack), but for my Blackberry it's great (both 8820 and Pearl). As a bonus, I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers (both with the attached messenger keyboard and without) for online gaming. Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller, but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug, but this doesn't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It's held up quite well over the past few years, being stuffed in bags and traveling around. It's not as cool as the wireless headsets (bluetooth etc) but it doesn't take batteries, doesn't have to be recharged and isn't subject to interference. I'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies.",Positive
I love the product even though I messed up and didn't know I needed a 3.5 so had to purchase adaptor.  I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service.,Positive
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties. The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time.,Positive
"I've been buying these headsets for several years, recommending them to friends and associates and now I'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged. You know, people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders.These are wonderful headsets. I've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones. As long as you have a 2.5mm socket, you're in business. Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss. And the microphones are simply top-notch.I've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed. With regard to ordinary daily abuse, these hold up well.All in all, an excellent value.Jerry",Positive
"A nice change for me - having a headset that doesn't slip and slide, fall out of my ear, or buzz. My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences. The only time is doesn't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset, and even then, I suspect that it is the fault of the listener's headset and not mine.",Positive
Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set. The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use.,Positive
Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices. This set has many uses for otherthings also. Product is as described and price is right. I recommend everyone having a set.,Positive
"I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws. The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job, so mission accomplished. The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft, meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you're screwing. (Sorry, there's no other way to say that.) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses, cameras, watches, fishing reels, hobbies, electronics, and small appliances. I think this set will come in very handy.",Positive
"Screwdrivers work well, however plastic separator tool tip broke off on the first phone case I used it to open...what a drag.",Positive
I like them but they are not super duty materials. Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped.  Im not too concerned because of the price. Over all good value!,Positive
"This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips. I believe they are also metric in sizes. I used one to take a part a netbook. I like the fact that they spin, come in a plastic kit. They are reasonably priced. These items are high quality. Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down. I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so... Nice case, nice color, small area, ... Comes in a card board cover as well. Packaged and more packaged. A little over doing it there. Can't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case. Was going push up or down. Comes with different sizes. Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade. Not a bad item for the price. Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws.",Positive
I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat. Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools.,Positive
"plastic pry tool kinda sucks, but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy, helped me fix a broken screen on a $500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there.",Positive
"The tools helped greatly. I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube. Everything was done in about 30mins, for a beginner like me. The battery, which replaced my 2-year old original one, works well so far after about one and half months. It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long. For average user like me, the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge.",Positive
Wish it was magnetized but it's sturdy & has the common pieces I need when I'm working on smaller items or electronics. Seems sturdy though only time will tell.,Positive
bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone. since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart. like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time.,Positive
"Used this in a phone I repaired, battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine, phone was on 5 percent, left it for two days, then I checked and it was on 1%, seems legit.",Positive
"I must agree with Gary Tuscon's review. For under $5, even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm (too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women's watchband), the quality is such that I will keep them. The case is very good and labeled very clearly. The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes, with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong, I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick, it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help, but really, this is an excellent value for the price.",Positive
These tools gets the job done. Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends. great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks!!,Positive
Very pleased with this tool kit.  I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit.  Would purchase again if necessary.,Positive
"This set has some very unique screw driver  heads, the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances. You would have a hard time finding some of them.",Positive
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost. Have every thing I needed (or more) to open my Motorola Droid.,Positive
"I should've ordered at least two sets.  These come in handy for a lot of things, home, workplace, etc.  And as soon as others know you have them, they need to &#34;borrow&#34;.  Keep you eye on them!  Great tool for a lot of little projects.  Fair price.",Positive
"These tools are better than expected. The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well. The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease. Similarly, the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized. Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy, but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking. In all, a good deal and I'm ordering a second set this evening.",Positive
Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery.  More tiny screwdrivers than I'll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed.,Positive
"After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure, I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour (which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart.  In fact, I'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I'd recommend (esp. for older folks with not-so-good eyesight) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you're doing.  I use a big magnifying glass, 1.5x reading glasses (3x would be better), a headlamp (to add light where I need it).",Positive
"Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one.  You will need tools, so I suggest you get one with tools.",Positive
I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit. These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease. Compact and easy to carry around.It arrived on time and in good shape. Thanks!,Positive
worked great,Positive
"I use these for electronics repairs.  There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs.  The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left.  They may not be the best tools on the market, but they have served me well.",Positive
"Nothing too special over here.  Just some screwdrivers.  Seem to hold up well.  I used them on my g-shock band, and they worked and didn't strip, so I was pleased.",Positive
"I got this to try and replace a screen, found out I'm not a phone repair person.  It did have what I needed, lacking skill needed to do the job.  I can replace my hard drive in my home computer, and add memory, this takes allot more skill.  If you have the skill, the tools are great and very complete.  I had everything the video said I needed, minus the skill.",Positive
very helpful and good quality,Positive
"I rate this 5 stars. Love this product! great price and quality. Love how it works with my iphone 4. And it comes with a lot of tools which is great, in case you misplace one of them.",Positive
Very fast delivery.  product is as described and useful tool.  If  you need a set of these this is a good one,Positive
I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done. Great for phone repair or and small electronics.,Positive
"I watched a short video on you tube then ordered this kit.  I changed the battery in just a few minutes.  Amazingly simple.  All the tools you need are here (the star screw driver is the only thing thats not really standard, but here its all in one place).  Just do it.",Positive
"You may not need these types of screwdrivers often, but when you do need them, nothing else will do.  They're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set.  It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes. They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time. The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws. The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver. It's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you don't step on it or drop something on it.  This set is a nice value for the price.",Positive
"It is chinesse(like almost everything in this world LOL) but they are really well done, and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure, and the body is rellay good, nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get, no problems with them and good finish on the edges, not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart(besides the iPad) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver, a flat an a phillips, I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied, I would buy another one later on",Positive
Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one. This setfills the bill nicely. When you need it you need it. A must have.,Positive
this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good,Positive
"Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size. Took a while, 3-4 weeks i'd guess, but was worth the wait! I'd easily recommend them.",Positive
"Like others have said here, the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever.  The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks.  So if you are looking for that type of set, this isnt the one to use.",Positive
"I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with, as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared. At the price, there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys. The best part so far, to me, is that they come already magnetized. I put them to use the day I received them, and am quite happy with them.",Positive
now I have it. I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong.,Positive
i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones  and price is right and tools work great,Positive
"I bought this for my wife's 2 year old iphone 4S.  She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery.  Not a huge improvement, but an acceptable replacement  if you need a new battery.",Positive
"This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set. I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing, so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other &#34;power users&#34; (i.e. slaves) of their iPhones, I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5's internal battery. After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available, I went with the &#34;you get what you pay for&#34; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece. Who knows how accurate that is, but if you're taking it at face value, I find certain comfort knowing that my battery hasn't been sitting on the shelf losing it's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone, I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone. Any copycat can do this, but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me. I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit. Do some extra research around properly removing the battery. Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive. That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement. After two months of use, I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger. My life is complete again!",Positive
This is a good buy if it is what you are wanting.  I misread the product info and did not realize this is all Torx screwdrivers.,Positive
This was a great deal.  Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s.  Does what it should and hopefully it will last.,Positive
"I fix my own phones and Tab 3 and Mac computers (desk top and laptop), and IPad(s). So having the right tools are very important to me. The price was the thing that did it for me. Great price!!",Positive
I bought this set and have repaired my android a few times already and it's a must have tool set when working on such small electronics,Positive
"Great tools, I still use them and I like the quality, great price as well.Good vendor.I would buy more.",Positive
"This tool set is better than expected. The machining and finish is very good. If used for small electronics and similar applications, this set should be durable.",Positive
This was a great deal for the set. High quality materials at a low price. I would recommend this product to a friend.,Positive
"Tools were required for opening GPS, iPOD, etc cases. Nice selection of sizes. The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged. A five star rating if it included a case (I would have even paid extra for a case)",Positive
"the Torx screwdrivers were great, the tweesers were substandard, and the spluger was very cheap, mine broke the first time i used it.  For the price you cannot expect high quality.  all in all it did the job",Positive
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money.,Positive
"For the price, you cannot beat this little Stanley screwdriver set.  This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers.  If you have a need for very small head screwdrivers, this one is for you.  These are useful for messing with eyeglasses, certain electronics gadgets, and firearms.  I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws.  For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did.  That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag.  RJB.",Positive
"This tool repair kit is useful for repairs on a laptop, smartphone, eyeglasses, and anything else with very small screws.",Positive
I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great. I'm really glad to have it around in case I need it again.,Positive
"i ordered this to replace my iphone battery, i am a deployed soldier and now i have become the cell phone technition",Positive
"The battery worked very well! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement, and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out. Still, a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S!",Positive
"I tried two (yes, two) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap. I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality. Well that seems to have paid off (third time's the charm I guess). The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly. It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage. The included tools were a bonus. I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife's battery a while back. However these were much better. The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads. This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly. Overall I'm very happy.",Positive
very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff,Positive
"very nice quality set of screwdrivers. they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper, but made by a different company. DO NOT BUY THEM. if you want a quality precision set of drivers. this is the company to go with.",Positive
Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered. Now it holds full charge and is ready to go. Great OEM repalcement. The tools are nice enough to use again too.,Positive
"I have never bought an actual set in a box before.  Over the years I have just cobbled together an odd assortment of small screwdrivers.  This was well rated, inexpensive, and in a case.  It is all that I expected.  It works for me.",Positive
Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and won't be worth it,Positive
Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back. Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels. Now I can wear my Jawbone all day! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets. And I intend to tell them! Jawbone Era is awesome too!,Positive
"I bought these eargels for my bluetooth, which happens to be a Samsung WEP200, and it fit it perfectly. Gives great comfort and a perfect fit. Comes with more than just three. Comes with a whole bunch. Highly recommended product",Positive
"I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset.  The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts.  But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out, unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels...  These made a huge difference.  It fit perfectly onto my ear (the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole).  I could wear this all day.  I wouldn't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era, but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece.",Positive
I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone. TO that end it worked like a champ. the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow. I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though.,Positive
"The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are.  Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..",Positive
"I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more.  Which, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls.I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying.  I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear.  Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset.  Also, while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I don't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear.  I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more.",Positive
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them,Positive
"These Ear Gels Work Very Well, Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them, Fit The Ear Very Well, The Price Was Right, You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels, That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars",Positive
Works great on ear buds. I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer. Great for wearing in the car during long drives.,Positive
"Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset. It was just not comfortable, but with these all is great now. Could not ask for a better set of earpieces. Great use of my money to get these.",Positive
"I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far.  And that is my biggest complaint, is their poor quality of workmanship.  They work well but just don't last.  Granted, I'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user.  The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid.  I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on.  At this price, I can afford it.  Also, Jabra customer services is great.  I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox, no charge.",Positive
these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price.Save $20. over a cell phone company price.,Positive
"Yeah, I know, they warned me; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so.If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you cannot shut the feature off, this will not work.  It may work for a few minutes at a time, but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes.If you can turn off the auto reverse (or don't have it), it's a very solid product that sounded great.For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version, I'd suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s.  We've been using it for a week or 2 with good results (and from my research, probably the best results you can get if you can't use a tape connection).",Positive
"Good Item, BUT.....The sound could be better...U get what u Pay For!!$8.00 for this as opposed to minimum $130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash.Well worth the couple of $$$",Positive
"I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse, but it worked the very first time in my '05 Audi A4 with factory stereo. The sound quality isn't CD level, but then again its better than my old FM transmitter.",Positive
"Purchased this to try out in the workplace. Don't have access to a decent sound system, so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available, without having to lug around a CD case. I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent. Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station. This model had some of the best reviews on the site, and it appears to be a good unit so far. I had to go with 5 stars because you can't beat the price for something that works this well.**Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far. It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.",Positive
"I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player. Until lately, my car tape player kept rejecting it out. I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again. While reading some other people's reviews, I bump into R. Penny's feedback on 10/26/05 about the ""skip"" mode as following:""One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some (but not all) car tape players have a ""skip"" mode. When a tape player's ""skip"" mode is active, it listens for silent portions of the tape. If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds, it will automatically go into fast forward until it ""hears"" sound again. If your tape player has a ""skip"" mode, be sure to cancel this mode - i.e., put the player in ""normal"" play mode. Otherwise, you will find the tape player trying to ""fast forward"" over any silent portions of your audio feed.""This is exactly the problem that I was having. By turning off the ""skip"" mode of the car tape player, my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again, even if it is indeed broken, I will buy the same product again. Very good product for the money.",Positive
"I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door. I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled, and can be stretched to be super long (probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked) yet when no tension is applied (during normal use or storage) the cord is only about 3 feet long. This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter. I more than got my money's worth out of it.",Positive
works great in my 2002 honda accord!  other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker.,Positive
"Just for kicks I did a ""local order"" at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday. I didn't believe it, so I figured, ""I'll pay for that and when it doesn't arrive on time I'll get my money back for the shipping cost"" (I mean come on, it was 300 miles south of me!!).  Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep.  That my friends is dedication to one's time commitment. Wow.As far as the product goes I love it! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it doesn't hang around getting tangled on my feet while I'm driving.  It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months.  The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly. Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality (without that white noise the tape players give off), adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75% volume and keep it there while plugged in.  From this point just use your car's volume to amplify the volume.Good luck!",Positive
"I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it. This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end. It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player, it plays through the system with no problem. I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about. I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours. It worked great.  The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back, depending on which way your auto player is oriented.",Positive
"OMG , if u have a tape deck and need AUX use this product , it's not exspensive and sounds great and works with MP3 , CD players , phones . its got awsome sound !!! way better than a FM Transmitter !!!!!",Positive
"I was using an FM modulator, but didn't like that with my iPhone, it would create feedback in the car speakers, so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter. This one works fantastic for the price. Sound quality is fine, about what you would expect from a cassette tape. The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically, which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use, it stopped working properly. My car's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck, and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks, then shut down on me and stopped, but if you look at J Cristofferson's review, there are tons of comments on how to fix this. I used these instructions to open the cassette (Carefully, lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces), and removed the tape reverse assembly. Then, as stated in that review, remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it, putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear. Put everyhting back together, and like magic, the cassette works perfectly now, even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it, but trust me, opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple. Takes about 5 minutes, and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever, so if I can do it, you can do it!",Positive
"Pros:- Love the adjustable dual position for the cord. Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways, but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise. You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap. It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20$- The coiled cord is great and much less clutter.  I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long, it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons:- The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already.",Positive
We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways. This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape. Sound quality is great. I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned. Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly.,Positive
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try's haven't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it doesn't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure.,Positive
"I would agree with the majority of the reviews. I purchased this for my car. I don't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck. And I wasn't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners (my brother has one for his car). There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing, but with road nose and the general nose of the car, it is a non-issue...can't even hear it. The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection, but I consider it very good...(not sure it's even fair to compare). I use this primarily for audio books, and I am very happy with my purchase. I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had (something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette).I would definitely recommend!",Positive
My car doesn't have an iPod connector so I bought this product. I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it. This works amazingly well.,Positive
I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm. After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm (closer the number to zero the better the reception). So I guess it works a little bit. Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after.,Positive
"DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY, BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE. I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID...THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT",Positive
"I've always had one of these on my phone. Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible!!! Slapped one of these on and, I don't know if it's the power of suggestion, but my new phone works soooo much better!!!! Love these things! Recommend!!!",Positive
"I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion, I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again, if fact I bought one for the whole family.",Positive
"It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular (phone) communications, but does nothing to improve my Android phone's 3G data signal or WiFi data signal. I didn't expect it to and I don't think it's design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that's what you're hoping for, forget it. If you want more bars... this works very well.",Positive
Order this product just to find out if it does work..and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception  in my cell than I had before and the price is right.,Positive
Its simply awesome. What else to say?,Positive
"I've had my T610 for about 3 months now and I'm still in love with it.  I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby.  I've downloaded Midi files, games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE!  No SMS charges or web site fees.  It's everything I wanted in a new cell phone.  Camera, color display, fully customizable.  It's great.  Battery life is still good.  Standby about 3 to 4 days, talk about 3 to 5 hours, maybe more.  The down side... Color display hard to see in bright daylight (but not impossible), it has frozen on me a few times, mostly with internet.  Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external,  but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing (inside bldgs).  Highly recommend, might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display.  Go get it!",Positive
"Overall, I think that it's a safe investment in a mobile phone. One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly, there's always a race to have the best.Right now, this phone is one of the best, without the 300+ pricetag. If you're paying 300 for it, you aren't getting a good deal.Clear reception, included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display. Only downside is the wiping it off thing. Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface. Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10.",Positive
"I've had mine for almost two months now and I'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone.  Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future.  I still don't like T-Mobile's coverage and especially service support, but this phone is a star.  Some may find teh buttons a bit too small, but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands.  Voice clarity is superb for me, and the quality/durability is great.",Positive
"Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155, I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) The Camera is great. The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email. Please don't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610. I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610. But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others. The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one's PC.2) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous. I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72, HP IPAQ 4155, and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great. If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC, then this is the phone for you. Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution. I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash. Moreover, web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone. Where I go in the boroughs of Queens, Bronx, Manhatten, Brooklyn and Nassau County (with the exception of Garden City) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has. So, if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network, I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC (outside of Staten Island). However, you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live.",Positive
"I've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now (So no word on the rebates yet) but as for the phone and service... I've been pretty satisfied.  I get pretty good reception everywhere... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch.  The camera is good enough for a cell phone... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port.  The phone doesn't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics (or at least all the ones it lets you), and that gave me more than enough.  It hasn't frozen on me yet (and mine came with the oldest firmware).  I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues, increases the quality/compression of the pictures, and overall makes the phone more useable... but I none of these things have affected me like others, so I haven't looked into how to upgrade it.  Unfortunately, you cant just update the firmware yourself...  Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it.  I think most the reviews on here are just people who've had negative experiences...",Positive
Good product. Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described. I am Very satisfied with this purchase,Positive
"This is an excellent replacement battery, it fit just fine and the price was amazing. Anyone needing to replace that old battery that won't hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these!",Positive
The item is working very good. My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither.,Positive
"If I'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone, it would've cost much, much more.  I didn't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap, I've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like!  The phone now works like new!",Positive
"I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam, even though this battery is great it was not the issue... It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should.",Positive
"Works great. I've been using this for over a year, seems to hold charge good as OEM (it is OEM)",Positive
"Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim. For those that don't know, the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear. She loves being hands free now. If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route, get this headset. It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack. Most smartphones are 3.5mm (like standard headphones).",Positive
I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest. You can barely tell you are wearing this thing. The mic picks up great! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy...,Positive
"This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased, yet the best small headset ever made. It lasts forever! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too. It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great. So if you're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone, buy this headset. I went ahead and bought another one before they're sold out. Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock, they are the best in my opinion.",Positive
"I don't know, I've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth, even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life. Don't get me started on static and wind noise.That's why for the money you can't do better than these wired units. They're lightweight, comfortable, and have ample cord length. I've ordered several, and you'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store. Do yourself a favor, even if you do own a bluetooth, keep one of these one hand. Well worth the price.",Positive
It's perfect for those of us who don't have smartphones or a headphone jack. Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier. Long wire so that you can put your phone in your pocket no problem.,Positive
Purchased a total of 3 so far.. 1st one had no sound but seller replaced immediately.. others were purchased to use by co-workers instead of the $50.00 apiece ones they were given from verizon purchase.. Stay in ear and work well...,Positive
"Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear.  The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece, may or may not be caused by the phone.",Positive
It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement. I ordered 3.,Positive
"I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it.  Well, my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work.  I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone.  I prefer the corded sets, they just seem to have a better sound quality.  I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe.  I wear glasses and this works out great.  I go between this style and one that wraps around my head, it just depends on which handset I pick up.  Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset.",Positive
"I've bought about 20 of these things by now, and shared them with many friends & family, who rave about them.  It's comfortable and fits in your ear, and the sound quality (especially the noise cancellation on the mic) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed: you have to charge them, they add latency, they add extra compression artifacts, and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire, but it's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset, and won't give you cancer.  (Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after, suspiciously, 6 months of very heavy cell phone use, I'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation).The jack is the smaller size (2.5 mm), which is unfortunate, as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm (so you can plug in a headset or just headphones).  So, once I got a smartphone, I ended up buying half a dozen adapters, because I love this headset so much.",Positive
"I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging (plastic bag), each coming with a ""universal"" adapter (micro-USB male to 2.5mm female). The price was substantially the same (per unit). But there is a small issue--there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units. The two on the right, with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have. Note the obvious button showing through the plastic (this one mutes, turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry, but it may do other things on other models). However, the other photos show the same headset, but without the control button--not a different button, but nothing at all! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150. The other issue is color. It's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice. From the photo, one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones, but I am not so sure. This is not exactly an item one buys for style points (it's compact, but looks bulky on the face), so it's a minor point, but it would be good to have some clarity.But, as far as the product itself goes, it's perfectly functional for the purpose--cheap branded headset (for me, specifically to complement a BT set, which this one replaces when charge runs out). I've had a number of cheap or free headsets (often even enclosed with a phone) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound. That's not what I want in a headset, even for $3. But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill. The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets--on both ends. It's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset--I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets. When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone, it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset. I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE (9 months later): I got another of these sets for a friend but, although it fit, the phone rejected it as not compatible. It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues. But that also meant that I got an extra set. About a month ago, one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard (probably a loose contact). At less than $2 each, I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one (and I still have two more left, having spent a total of $6, including shipping). So, aside from Nokia compatibility, still no complaints.",Positive
"The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded. IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional. I love it, has great sound, cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings.",Positive
I have an old style flip phone which uses 2.5mm plugs. This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free.,Positive
No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work.  Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband (Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000) (waiting for delivery).  Highly recommended headset regardless!,Positive
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them.  This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used.  The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office.  I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for. This device solved both problems.  The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control.  It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call.  It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease.  The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit.  Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me.  Not with this unit.  The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty.  The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy.  This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today.  It is great!,Positive
Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing.  Easy integration with current phone system. I would buy again if needed.,Positive
"I took one start off, because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting, and this one was the best deal that I could find! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this.That being said, this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work, so I may edit my review later. I am impressed so far. The setup was super easy. I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went! There was something in the description about &#34;USB,&#34; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input. There is not USB on this model. The company does make a USB model, but this is not it. I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me, he was very helpful.I am using the mute feature now, and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted. I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do, but I can still hear what is being said on the other end.Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day, or work from home like I do, get one!",Positive
Mine died and I needed a new one. Works perfect just like my old one. Good product would recommend to anyone.,Positive
"I've had this headset for many years (at least 5+, but I can't remember exactly when I got it).  I am giving it 4 stars for:-simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable, with a variety of wearing options-durability (still serves its purpose after 5+ years)I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons:-Over the course of several years, the charger has gotten finicky.  If I don't place the headset in just right, and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection, it doesn't charge.  Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger, and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset, which means you MUST use the headset.  I've looked at set up, but there is really only one way to connect the wires, so I don't believe there is way to avoid this.  The simple solution is to just always use the headset, which is fine, but......on those occassions where the headset is dead (see above), you're left with no great option.  When that happens, I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again.  Not a really big deal, but then I get people asking ""talk me off speaker phone"", and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older, the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models.  Since this unit is still for sale, and apparently people are still buying it, I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind.....know what you are getting with this.  If you have a typical desk phone, then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls, and physically lower the handset to end calls.  You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you, but I've never had one, so I can't comment on them.  I've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters, but do your own research.  Regardless, just know that for a typical desk phone (i.e. one that is used in a home office, with the phone line going into the phone),  You can't just tap to talk or tap to end the call.  Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset.  If you have a ""soft phone"" (calls over the inernet), or are in an office environment with a PBX type system, I can't comment.  My experience is stictly in a home office environment.",Positive
I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say: &#34;This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip. My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry. I would recommend this to anyone who needs  tough waterproof case.&#34;,Positive
I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer.  It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof.  I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone.  Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack.,Positive
"very durable, water tight, use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry, the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut",Positive
"This case works great! My wife and I are taking up kayaking and we needed some way to protect our phones. I have a samsung galaxy s2, she has a blackberry bold 9000. We each put our phones in our cases and immediately plunged them into the water to test to make sure they didn't leak. They worked perfectly! My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test, we righted it and checked the phone, dry as can be.I recommend these, i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit. I'll put my own inside, but for the price I think they could have included something.",Positive
"I have one of these filled with charging cables (both dock and lightning) for iPhones and iPads, car chargers, wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling... conveniently placed and easy to grab if we're going anywhere, knowing all the while that we don't have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house. Keeps everything safe, secure and dry.",Positive
"I don't want to rehash all of the stuff that's already been said about this phone. Here's something that nobody told me before I bought it: You cannot use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC. You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity (this works for me) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc. does not work with Infrared. I've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this. When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable (read: shell out another $70) for that purpose. It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW, I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone.",Positive
"..and I'm from Europe, where the phones and networks are much better than in the States. I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software (and I used to be a huge Nokia fan). Amazingly light, very intuitive, great audio, and just looks great. I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever.",Positive
"I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out. FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!Now the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E7154) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.5) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.Overall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.",Positive
"And it was pretty much worth it (if you sign the plan and get the phone for $250). Otherwise it is a little pricey. The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though, and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there. It's difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky. The features are the same but a little better. And of course GPS is nize.",Positive
"I've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone, and think it's a little underrated.  I've had a couple weeks to try out mine, and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days, and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day.  The phone doesn't squeak when squeezed, and all of the construction is tight (even the flip screen doesn't wiggle much).  I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone, and even a complaint about the metal battery panel.  It's called quality, sometimes quality weighs a little, and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it's hooked onto your jeans, buy a belt.  The phone employs java applications, so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel, at a cost.  You can also get them from third party sites, also ringtones, wallpaper, etc.  The phone uses GPS, can locate your approximate position for free, with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free (navigational software), called telenav.  The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great.  The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house, or quiet enough you can barely hear them.  The sound is crisp, even on direct connect.  Also, an answer to the slams against nextel itself, don't listen to it.  The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7,  other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I've ever worked with.  This phone is full featured, it isn't exactly a PDA phone, but it's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA.  Great phone, if nextel services your area, you won't be disappointed.",Positive
"Other than the high initial cost (I got it before they put in a promotion, duh), i really love this compact and stylish phone.  It's the best Nextel has offered yet, although there's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon.  If you can wait, wait a bit longer, otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular, Nextel is the best.  No delays like with Verizon (up to 30 seconds!) or Sprint (10 secs).  Walkie-talkie that actually works where there's coverage.  I'm a happy customer.",Positive
"I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c,I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it,the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best.",Positive
A phone which has got lots of very useful features and functions.Pros:Very Good reception. Works great inside buildings.Clear beautiful color screen and camera. One of the best out thereCons:The buttons are kind of small and needs getting used to.Little bulky if you compare it to a Samsung flip phones. But does things better than the Samsung.,Positive
"The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up.  From the deal I'm seeing on here, i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account, but thats too much effort.... anywho, my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300.  I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets (mainly the camera and speakerphone) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong!  Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air!  i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105, but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional!  I'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two (meaning signal strength).  Clarity is a tad better in the S105, but nothing worth chosing that over this.  If there is even the slightest background noise, they sound the same.  The S105 and this are almost identical in size, but the E105 was smaller... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line: If you are a prude about clarity and size, go with E105.  If you want more from a phone than just making calls, get the v300 (or higher).",Positive
"I've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features.  Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days, but a few things are worth commenting on:-Great speakerphone.  Very loud and clear sounding, both ways.-Decent battery life.  Almost lasts a week with minimal usage; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge.  Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice, clear display.  A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight, but other than that, no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best.  Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper, but that's about it.-Serious annoyance: One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate.  It's very loud if you don't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only.  Basically, to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent--say in a theater--you have to make a loud noise.  Very short sighted.  And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed, you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.  I could've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera, but not with a speakerphone, or with speakerphone, but not at this price.  (...)  Can't beat it on value.",Positive
"First a quick confession: I do not like T-Mobile.  I had them before and hated their (lack of) coverage and bad service.That said, the v300 is a very good phone.  I won't rehash the long feature list here.  What I really like (after playing with a friend's) is the loud ringtones, the good reception (despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn), and the great styling.  This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the &quot;girlish&quot; styling, but it's still pretty cool.  Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS...",Positive
"This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT&amp;T.  I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings.  I chose the V300 due to the external antennae.  I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased.  The reception is a bit tinny sometimes, but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text.  The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose.  This method is supposed to save time, but I have not yet gotten the hang of it.  The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method.  My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first.  Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons.  The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall, I would recommend this phone.  The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems.",Positive
I recently used two of the plug on a trip.  I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly.  I would recommend this set.,Positive
They look cheap but work great. I took these on a trip to China and had no problems at all.,Positive
"UPDATE:The person actually using these adapters (an 80 year old grandma) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues. So if a octogenarian can deal with something, that speaks volumes to the product!In her case, she was using an iPhone overseas, so any issues of power converters were moot. All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter. Even so, it did work for her and she did it on her own. So that is a plus!**********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back!",Positive
Bought this for a trip to Europe (Netherlands) and it worked perfectly without any kinks. I am quite pleased with my purchase.,Positive
"I was happy with this purchase. Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics (Iphone, Ipad 3) and was very impressed.I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3, but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store, that it would be just fine, and it was!So I recommend this.",Positive
"I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe. There are two different Europe plugs, I took them both, and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway, they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod, iPhone, iPad, camera batteries, etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs, the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs. It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them, but at least they have the numbers (which I didn't see at first so I put my own numbers on them).I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips, and I'll keep this updated.Update:Have also now used in Thailand, worked great.",Positive
"Works as it is supposed to, lightweight, compact, and very economical.  Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India.",Positive
"A few months ago, Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out, and I have been pleased with all of them so far. This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review, these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years. Still, with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten, I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market. This particular charger offers dual USB charging (1A and 2.1A ports) as well as a standard power socket. Let's cut to the chase: this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue, and it's not Sabrent's fault. My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power (cigarette lighter) low down on the console, right behind the shifter, and with this inverter plugged in it's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out. If you're in the same boat as me, I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent, also 150W:Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product, another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space, this is an excellent converter and a solid price. Recommended for most, reservations for some.",Positive

"It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",Positive
Bought this thing years ago and it hasn't stopped working. It was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine. I haven't used it recently because not needing it.,Positive
"A very nice power inverter, especially for the price. Just be aware of the wattage required for what you're trying to run. I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot, with no result. After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run.",Positive
"I'm standing in a room with a TV blasting, just 10 feet away.  Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me (a) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and (b) they don't hear the TV at all.  I replace this unit with my old earphone.  ""Now your voice sounds muffled"", he said, ""and I hear that TV now loud and clear"".I have other stories like this.  Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind.  My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise.I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place.  I don't like the hard plastic ear pieces.Nice.",Positive
"I started using this headset two days ago.  Sound is good.  You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard.  I don't use it outside though.  The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater, the way it blocks your whole ear canal.  But that's how it blocks out noise.  I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable.  But, I knew there wasn't when I bought it.  My only complaint is that it comes with a case, yet the headset doesn't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I'm not comfortable doing that.  It's sensitive equipment, with a filter in the earpiece that I know I'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same, then it shouldn't be left in the open to collect dust.  Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories?UPDATE 4/30/08:  After months of using this headset, I have to say I find it mildly annoying.  You feel like you're hearing something under water, because the thing is so jammed in your ear (it's a little bit violating...).  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset.  I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT&T; 8525.",Positive
"This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I've ever used (over a dozen). It comes with a the headset, a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug, a small and large windscreen, and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case, plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool. I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros:Very high quality speaker. Like high quality headphones, if you phone has good signal it sounds great, but you'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal. I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline. It didn't sound as good with HTC and Samsung (CDMA) phones, but this is indicative of the quality of the phone's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on, you can use it outdoors even in strong wind (20 mph). Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction. It's light enough so it works well. This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket. Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly, friction alone holds the unit in place. It is pretty durable too (sitting on it or dropping it)Cheap - for $35, it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too (call center sets, theBoom)Cons:2.5mm plug. Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm. Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended (4-5 hrs) use. The plugs are made of soft plastic so you need to air out your ear after a few hours (no discomfort then)",Positive
"I have a BlueParrott, but I keep forgetting to turn bluetooth on, or it is paired with something else so I've been wishing for a wired headset with noise cancelling ability for a long while.  This is it.On my motorcycle you can't hear the engine, and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds (sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through.  You can't hear my stereo blaring.  I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom doesn't quite reach the corner of my mouth.  But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise (you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments).A few nits:They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished.  A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome.  The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they don't include an iPod/Blackberry/(some)Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter, but I already have several.  They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect, but this is way beyond all the other ""handsfree"" wired headsets I have used, and it isn't that expensive for what it does.",Positive
"I have bought other USB hubs in the past, and they all failed. plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems! This is one of the best Hubs I have found.",Positive
This usb port is sleek and functional. It is plug and play. It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals. Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer. It comes with a lifetime warranty. I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less.,Positive
"Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC, Mac; desktop or laptop.  I don't disagree. I think it works as promised, and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty. I like the solid base and the layout of the device. It's powered (AC) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility. No driver disc or software to mess with is great.  Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what's wrong with it?  I give this product a 4-star rating only because I can't shut off the blue power light, which is so bright, it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light! Since the room doubles as our guest room, it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device.",Positive
"I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with.  Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub... I am very pleased with it.  I'm not a techy, just an every day computer user.  I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly, have had no issues.  I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well.  Like I said, it does what it says it will do with little effort, and works quite well for the technically challenged.",Positive
"Okay, this little guy ROCKS!  When plugged in to an outlet, it will support 2 HDDs, a external ODD, and a printer with no issues.  Also, during a move I misplaced my power cord, so I called up the company... WOW, for free, the NEXT DAY, they shipped me out a replacement.  I would DEF. buy from them again, and will use more of these as the need arises.Also, it's been quite some time now since the purchase (over a year) and it works perfectly like the day I got it.",Positive
"i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job, the dlink i used on another system kept losing connection in the middle of transfers i threw it away, this one works.i use lots of usb devices and i have TWO of these on ONE computer and they work fantastic.  when i copy movies to my personal video player from my network hard drives these never fail.  the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer. i have 2 printers, 2 scanners, video capture, mouse, and keyboard, tv, external hard drives, 2 flash card readers, docking for sandisk mpeg player, docking for ipod player, external game system for updating firmware, wacom drawing board for adobe cs3, and other attachments i hook on and off.  these hubs always works.downside, ive had to learn the tricks of windows xp on keeping track of drive letters and changing them around, there are third party programs that i have tried but i'd rather use disk manager and do it myself.you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around, but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem.",Positive
"I really like this hub.  I have an Acer One Netbook, and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive, my laptop cooler pad, and my 1tb external hard drive.  My cooler pad also has a few usb ports, and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that.  Everything works fine.  Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly.  I had that same problem with another hub though, so I think it's the drive.  It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small.  The main picture makes it look huge, but it's really palm sized. I took it with me on vacation, and it fit just fine in the carry-on.  You don't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive.",Positive
"For one, this product is built very cheap. This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working...why? I'm not really sure...perhaps cheap components, and slight bending?Secondly, it does not support charging, and yet it does at the same time. If you plug in say an apple device you'll get an error, but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub, it's a 2.0. Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future. For instance, my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly: Mine is just about destroyed, because of a slight drink mishap. Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than...it stops working from time to time, and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes: The Stand is horrible. It won't stay on, especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable. (It falls out easily, it does not snap on, it's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it ""rests"" on top of. (Useless)- It glows neon Blue. Why? I'm not sure. I like it because it matches my setup, but it's very bright, and I'd rather the ""power"" be used towards the other devices.Finally: This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time....I would get 3-4 to work...maybe.... at any given point. Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to ""not work"" entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with. This also made me think there was something wrong with my device, and wasted my time trouble shooting. (just had to switch ports) In other words...don't buy this device...get a cheaper hub with more slots, or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap...",Negative
"Positives: Bluetooth, IR port, VGA Camera, multiple e-mail accounts, speaker phone, more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S. I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives: phone too big; voice recognition worthless, low volume from ear piece, IR port weak so TV remote control programs don't work well, slow menu's and response. Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you (Opera has problems on this phone, but works most of the time).

"i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it, but what i didn't test out was the reception/range. i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it, EXCEPT for the fit. it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines. it fits great. it doesn't hurt. i can wear it for hours. it seems to have a ton of talk time (at least 6 hours, i would say)...but the reception just plain sucks. i don't know if it's all the electrical devices running in my apartment, but damn, i can't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me. you almost have to have the phone 1) within about 6 feet of you and 2) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra. basically, count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device! and your microwave. and your electric fans...and running water...they all make reception horrible. i think my problem might have been the wireless home network. but c'mon people, us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks. duh.summary:pros:*lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ($42 shipped for new)*easy to usecons:*range, range, range! this is a huge one for me. if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time, what's the point?*too costly at $80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit. you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say, it's for sale on ebay!",Negative
"I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died.  Actually, I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it.  I was impressed with the advertised battery life, and took the plunge.  Shouldn't have.  While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle.  You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight.  Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it?  And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it.  So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.  On the plus side, the sound is nice and loud in th speaker.  That's about it.  Try something else, like a bluetrek or motorola or something.  I am trying the Motorola next.

"Magnetic mounting is a joke.  It is guaranteed to fall over, scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount.

"Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster, and it is not the right antenna. Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it. This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon's problem. I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so, but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception.  Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry.

"They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it won't pick up any signal! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker!  I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it doesn't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive. I tried emailing Wilson but they weren't any help. Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760. I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work. The first one had bad threads and wouldn't go on all the way, the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it. The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal. I don't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this, they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints. I'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna, mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great. This one must have been defective.",Negative
"This didn't do much for me. Unfortunately, it may not be the blame. Ironically, I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes (I thought). This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution. So in the mobile world, I'm sure this would be helpful. It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage, location, type of usage, cell frequency and more. So in putting a system together, for a whole home solution, you'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system.",Negative

"I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now. I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones. (The early blue tooth standard isn't really as ""standard"" as one might hope!) However, it has proven rather fragile. Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch.  Did not impact usability so I didn't care.  For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger (several of my colleagues are having similar problems).  The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked. I keep the unit in my briefcase, so I don't know why it is proving as fragile as it has.  If you can use it (or the similar HS850) with some assurance that it will not be crushed, it is a good choice.  Otherwise, I suggest looking at other designs.",Negative

"The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing.

That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS.  But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken, it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up.  I tried pressing keys and waiting.  I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected.  No matter what I do it will not reconnect.  I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work.

"It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop.  You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it's new surroundings.  I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor....to boxing it up to send back when it wouldn't sync to my Axim x50v....to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly, I now love it again.  The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable.  It's great for writing a longer e-mail, inputting contacts, or writing a letter in word, when you don't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly.  The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap.  Pun intended. The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA.  It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you.  But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just don't want to let go.  The plastic it's made out of doesn't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually.  Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim, et al, is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it's holding.  Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it. I previously gave it one star, but now that it's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5.

I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that: ""Unfortunately, we do not have a driver for that device currently.""  So, I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly ""for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds.""By the way, the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices, only with Smartphones.  A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate, in small letters, that it also works for Blackberry.  In my case, though, back it goes, which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it.  In the mean time, I guess I'll keep looking.Lastly, I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit.

It's on my belt clip, and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away, signal is weak, and then disconnets. To me that's strange. It's also surprising that this happens randomly, so it's kinda annoying, b/c you can't anticipate it. Kinda annoying when driving, b/c you rely on the headset to work properly.

Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone. There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise. This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking. The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic. As a result the fit isn't tight enough. I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat. It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",Negative
"I've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst. The sound quality is low, especially outdoors, and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone. The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside (with any background noise) it was almost impossible. This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear (earbud style). The microphone is far enough from one's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable, especially if you wear glasses, but not as bad as some others I've tried. It does not flop around much under normal circumstances. I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500, which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price, but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250. I've used those in the past and found them much better overall, and worth the extra price.",Negative
"I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it, so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice, this item came in with extremely cheap package and it's sound quality is worse than my previous one. My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one. Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging.",Negative
"The voice reception with this headset was just ok. Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving. I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it. It may be something to do with  the design of the head set. Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain, and I have to believe them...It's weird though that I get always get a tingling, achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes. So try as I might, I cannot wear it for prolonged periods of time. After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging. I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging. However, now the headset just died...after 2 months. I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it. It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one. I'm waiting for the replacement to come back. Who knows how long this one will last!",Negative
"This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either.  The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy, long-term usage.  It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog.  I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life (Oddly, it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty).  I am surprised that Motorola couldn't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line (the volume doesn't go up very high).  It's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great.  Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall, I like the idea of bluetooth but I haven't found a great headset yet.  I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you don't find anything else in the price range that you like, buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside:  I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset.  When I compared the two chargers, they were identical.",Negative
"and i'm fairly disappointed! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $80 and i am thinking it's going back before my 30 days are up! in summary, considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make, this is just NOT worth $80, period. even if this device worked flawlessly, it might be worth about $30 at best.here are my gripes:* it says it has a range of about 30 feet. hmmm...not really. i am even using this headset with a motorola phone (V505)and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south. not the biggest deal in the world. even when i am close to the phone however, there can be some interferance (""crackling"") and distortion. usually mild though. it seems like my microwave interferes with it (when it's cooking)!* doesn't fit snugly on my ear. rather, it kind of ""hangs"" there. it doesn't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment, so here's hoping it fits your ear. using this headset while lying down is hard to do; the device doesn't seem to want to stay put.* drops the bluetooth connection every now and again, even when i am at close range.the ""good"":* looks cool! ;)* battery life seems to be pretty good.* small, lightweighti am going to look into some other options. this simply was a waste of money.",Negative
"The audio is very soft of this headset.  I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it.  Also, it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone, so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds.",Negative
I bought this from Amazon. I linked quickly and worked as advertised.  I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume.  Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise.  I found it only adequate in a quiet room.  I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal.  I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car.  It is fine if your sitting in quiet room.,Negative
"This thing just doesn't work well with the Treo 6501. it doesn't automatically connect, when a call comes, or when a call is initiated2. the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good, but for the price, there are many BETTER headsets out there ----consider the Cardo Scala, the Jabra JX10, and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping!",Negative
"Lasted 3 months, lucky I have two(charge one, while using the other), the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use, hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though, but These items need to last the day.",Negative
"I am not impressed.I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking.  This device does not cancel out background noise.  Listeners on the other end say I sound like I'm in a tunnel.  Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one's mouth and the ""pinhole"" for the internal microphone.  There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise.  This is a design defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking.  The ""ear attachment"" and its hinge is made of flimsy loose plastic.  As a result the fit isn't tight enough.  I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing's going to fly off my head into the back seat.  It's an extremely annoying distraction that you don't want to have while driving.On the good side, I don't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use.",Negative
"This headset seems to work fine, but the audio quality is nothing to write home about, to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone. They will also hear a lot of background noise. I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset. It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And, you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone. But I admit that it's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires, which feels a bit safer and freer, especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit (or your phone) in a hot car! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan.",Negative
"Don't purchase these if you plan to use in your car. The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source, my Sirus Radio in my case, you'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm's increase and decrease. You get what you pay for.",Negative
"Received it, plugged it in, didn't work. Tried jostling the cable and plug around, couldn't get it to work. Can't recommend it.",Negative
"Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone. The cable does not work. I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it's fully plugged in. In order to hear stereo, i need to hold cable out to before the spring click. Unfortunately this doesn't suit my needs for the car.",Negative
"it's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3. battery life is only about 48hrs (standby) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone's spec says.4. phonebook is pretty messedup. phone book name displys only first half of first line, although it allows you to enter two lines.5. on/off button some times takes second try.6. it's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile... under one name.7. phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it won't charge. design is pretty messed up.8. 1/8"" of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9. signal is very poor. I'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year.",Negative
"I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s. I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae&#8217;s which needed to be pulled out of the phone.  Since the phone antennae&#8217;s have changed, I haven&#8217;t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them. I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth. The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters.",Negative
"This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone, I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength. I guess that's the reason why they're selling so cheap. Do not waste your time with this product.",Negative
"Didn't work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 (Verison, AT&T, T-Mobile) doesn't matter. It wont work.",Negative
This does not work at all. And once you put it on it is so hard to took off. Never again!!!!,Negative
I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL. I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT.,Negative
these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try. but really not worth a dime,Negative
you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that,Negative
"We've had the Sidekick II for about two months.  Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value, I find it very awkward to use as a phone.  It doesn't have a normal keyboard, so you must flip the screen up to press the keys, then flip the screen back down to listen and talk.  When you get into a voicemail situation, you have to keep flipping the screen up to ""press 1 for English"", etc.  Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $20 per month if you want to browse the Internet, use Instant Messaging, or even Download Fun.  Otherwise, all you get is phone calls and text messaging (which is also extra).  Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage.  The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter ""A"" has fallen out.  It occasionally just freezes for no reason. The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone, so you can't take it out to let the phone reset itself.  No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip, for example.Internet browsing is cool, but so slow you think it stopped working.  I think some of the fault is just the slow connection, but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it's trying to display.Oh, yeah.  Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $9.95 to set up your album on its web site, then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction.  You can't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper, it isn't really ready for prime time.",Negative
"Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing, web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go.  You can also download limited content.  You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook, but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program.  Compared to the original Sidekick, SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer.  I also think it's uglier, esp. the new thumb keyboard, but the keyboard is still very useable.  Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks, requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service, though, is the poor quality of T-Mobile's GPRS coverage.  T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM (voice) coverage in the U.S.  When it comes to GPRS (data), it's even worse, and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt.  And when that happens, SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns.  This makes a very frustrating user experience, esp. when you need Internet access the most (e.g., when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store).  Unfortunately, T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed, so if you get the SK, be prepared for slow speed and lost connections.  Once the novelty factor wears off, the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course, currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II.  If you are an absolutely Internet junkie, you'll probably find T-Mobile's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK's true wireless Internet access appealing.",Negative
"I regret buying this phone, it's really big, and verizon service isn't that great with this phone.  For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1, or will have 1 bar when i'm getting no service.  That said, the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD, the outer LCD is pretty bad.  You can play with the settings. It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of.  The camera is terrible, which is pretty much true with all cell phones though, so that's a non unique gripe. The phone is also moderately fruity, like when you make or recieve calls, the outer LED will start blinking purple, blue, pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl, and the menus are all kind of childish.  That said, when the phone does have some bars, calls never drop and it's pretty easy to set up the phone.  I'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones, i recently switched from tmobile, but im sure you can do better than this phone, good luck.",Negative
"I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away. It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!",Negative
"the ""behind the ear"" thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly, and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago, but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset, but not just a replacement, an $85 replacement! Then told me to keep the broken one, which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue!Really incredible customer support...I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name!BTW, 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue.",Negative
"I'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz,bells and whistles, and generally go for performance and practicality. Sound quality and features are fine for the price.  But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy; the weight is unbalanced, as well.  I could not get a comfortable fit.  My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.  I wasn't, and am returning it.  I'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try;  if it's no good, I'll probably go with a Jabra, and spend a bit more money.",Negative
"The sound quality was excellent, but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable: terrific electrical engineering, poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it wasn't broken.  Even wind didn't seem to bother the headset much.  The voice quality was great on transmission and reception.  But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can't be replaced.  I got a new headset the first time on warranty.  The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I didn't want the hassle.  I have a Scala now that I've been using for months and I'm very happy with it, even though the sound and wind-immunity doesn't measure up to the Logitech.",Negative
It says it's compatible with all Motorola handsets...  It doesn't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks.  Very disappointing.,Negative
"Set it up, it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop. Returned and purchased a different item. Didn't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing.  Can't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair, I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice (though it does work great with Cisco IP phone). I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good.",Negative
"I have had this phone almost 6 weeks (40 days).  At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working (a, s, d, f, and g, etc).  I was told to call Palm in India, which I did, and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up, because I have really loved Palm.  This is my fourth Palm device, though it will likely be my last.  I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation.  My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices (my cell phone, my Palm T3 and my laptop).  And then, that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course, when I took the phone to Sprint, they said it was Palm's responsibility to repair.  When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes, as they always do.  Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink, that they said they would give me - this one time - a ""free return and repair,"" meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days. They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $25 to get a refurbished replacement, complete with a 90-day warranty (which I now know means nothing).  These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just don't work, and that I needed something immediately.  I don't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people, or how I can be made to feel like they're doing me a favor by standing behind their product.  I am the customer!  Doesn't that mean anything anymore?I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad (though Amazon's remains very, very good).  When a person spends $400 on a phone, or any device, it should work longer than a few weeks.  But when it does stop working, the company that sold it should stand behind their product, instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility.  Subsequent to this occurrence, other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s, as well.There are other issues with this phone.  Out of the box, the power/sync cord did not work.  I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced.  (I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle, which works fine.) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume.  Every so often, the phone just resets itself - can't figure this one out at all.  Also, when someone calls in on Call-Waiting, you cannot disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call; in other words, when you accept the Call-Waiting call, it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously, even when the first party hangs up.  This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also, there are limited, non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone.  And don't get this phone for its camera: cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise, all the Palm applications work as they should, and as they have for the past number of years.  Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all, I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device.  My company will stop using Palm, and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint (when contracts start to expire).My apologies for the rant, but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers.  Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore?  I know mine tries to; otherwise, we're out of business.",Negative
"I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it. The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box, so call them, don't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very, very good, there are other issues with the unit. First, the fit on my particular ear is horrible... always feeling like it was going to fall off. I never trusted it walking through airports as it just didn't feel secure.Second, the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months. The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose, then broke off. I note that others have metioned the same thing. It just wasn't well constructed. Bummer! I've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics, but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo, I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality.",Negative
"Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews, and I've been fairly disappointed by the performance I've experienced.  My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint's LG-PM325.First, the audio quality was not good.  If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset, I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception.  Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio.  When using the headset with my phone, while the phone was in my front pocket, the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable.  And it's not by hearing.Second, there's the shiny blue light.  When I read other's comments about the flashing blue LED, I really didn't think much of it.  But in the dark, this thing is a strobe light.  At night, with my headset left on some countertop downstairs, and while I was upstairs, I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling.  That's part A.  Part B, the flash results in a very slight audible clicking, not unlike when a camera flash goes off.  Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence, be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good.  Pairing was excellent.  The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably, and making or answering calls was straightforward.I've returned mine because of the two problems.",Negative
"I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip.  When I received the order, the clip would not fit on my glasses, and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction (the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box).The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com.",Negative
"Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully.  As for me, there were two main problems.  First, I found the sound level to be too low.  While it's easy enough to turn up the volume, the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end.  The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone.  I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but, after that time, I decided to send it back and keep looking.",Negative
"I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece, where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end, even landline to landline, there is an annoying whine and some echo, no matter what the setting.  This isn't good enough, I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon.",Negative
"I bought, exchanged, and then returned this unit.  Both units delivered to me would not turn on.  When I charged them using the supplied adaptor, the red charging light came on and a few hours later, the unit was supposedly fully charged.  However, when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button, nothing happened.  The unit never came on, could not be paired, and never worked.  I returned both of them.  I can understand one unit being bad, but two units that were shipped several weeks apart shouldn't be.When I called for technical support, I waited on hold for sometime, and then gave up.",Negative
"I bought this item @ a local retailer, was happy cause i got it on sale (probobly clearance) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched!  I can not find my receipt, so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this isn't an issue! wanting to know how many phones i tried, if i tried more than 1 headset, etc.... i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S&H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement!  Just get a nice wired headset, less $ spent & less headache!",Negative
I could NOT get it charge. Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it. I ask for help on this and got no where. But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great.,Negative
"It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these, it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert, but I am afraid I can't recommend these.",Negative

"I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore, I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement, and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson.",Negative
The device was not as the description. It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down. I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them.,Negative
was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him,Negative
"This Bluetooth sucks. Plain and simple... I mean I paid, what, $15 for the thing so wasn't expecting the best but at least working quality. I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $60 but I always lose them. Always! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I wouldn't cry in the corner losing out on a day&#8217;s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my (what is this my 6th) Bluetooth. But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it. Hell, even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause.",Negative
"I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710. Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry. The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software. Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710. To bad, the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me.

I have three cell phones in my family, perfect credit, no earthly reason why I wouldn't be approved for a cell phone account, just the above message with no explanation. Of course, there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation. I don't know if my form was missing some information, or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened. I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order, they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before, usually good service, but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments, it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads.",Negative
"My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago. In that time (during which the phone was never dropped, bumped, etc), I've replaced my phone twice, and hers once. The problems we've had include:- random ""white screen of death""- Bluetooth connectivity problems (isolated to phones)- dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous ""Unable to Charge"" problemAdd to that Motorola's lousy phonebook and UI, and retarded Bluetooth handling (e.g., if any BT device is connected, the same Moto default ring sounds, regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones), and you have an overpriced, overhyped, oversize paperweight.I'm fortunate Cingular offers my company's employees discounts on new phones, so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson. My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service, even after having been dropped twice. It's on its 2nd owner now, who has used it for 6 months problem-free.",Negative
"My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket. There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure. This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before. I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel. Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip, full support for bluetooth (although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling. I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i don't know whether its the service or phone. Overall i want to like the phone but i'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it.",Negative
Doesn't stay on even if you figure out how to get it on. The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you can't hear. The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise.  The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient. Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire.,Negative
"This fell apart after one use, and the person I called couldn't even hear me when it wasn't broken to pieces.  VERY disappointed! :(",Negative
"This model, the C150, is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used, however, all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one, the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I found that it worked well with a cell phone, but not with a cordless phone.",Negative
"I screwed up; shouldn't have ordered this; it's of no use to me.  Since the real price was hidden in the ""shipping and handling"" it's pointless to return it; I'll just write it off as an ""educational expense"".I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a ""hands free"" 2.5mm jack. (Siemens cordless phone system).  The owners manual says ""...any 2.5 mm headset"", so that's what I bought.  I don't even know where this thing is anymore; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud, ""screeching"" sound...  ...playing with the plug, I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone, but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I can't get it to work on anything else either including my wife's Samsung Intensity (which also has a 2.5mm headset jack; same results), but I don't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid; buying this was one of those occasions.",Negative
"These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement, and it's the same situation.I am not sure if it's because I'm using a Nokia E71x, but they both don't work properly.",Negative
"There's a problem with the design of this headset. The jack used is too short. It's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement. If you don't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still, you'll loose the connection. I don't know why they designed it that way...",Negative
"I doesn't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery.  You really do get what you pay for, don't you?",Negative
"This is the 3rd ""OEM"" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders, Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.",Negative
They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them. Not much better than the old ones I was replacing.,Negative
I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby (not making calls) before it went dead.  I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR.  They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem.,Negative
"I agree with other reviews... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume.  I'm glad it came free with my phone, because if I'd payed for this... I'd be pretty mad.",Negative
"Summary: Stay away, this product sports a very poor design...Pro:+ very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon:- morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone.  1 short beep, 2 short beeps, 3 short beeps, 1 long beep, 3 beeps up, 3 beeps down.  like another reviewer said,  you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it, partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door.  I got so frustrated, I was about to throw this thing out of the window.  For a product that use regular batteries, the battery door is the most difficult to open.  Once opened, you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out.  The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug.  This must be a sick joke by Motorola.  Forget about changing the battery on the go, you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience.  (for the record: this was my breaking point, i had to return this unit, because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off)- sound quality is mediocre at best",Negative
"Quality and value of this item are fine, but WHOA, it smells SO BAD!! Just like bug spray! I returned it promptly.",Negative
I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out. It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone. Very disappointed.,Negative
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all. You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse. Money part needs length to really pack some cash in. Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase.  Id say purchase a cheaper product like this. Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless.  Buyer be aware. Update. I stopped using this. The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it. Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces. Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone.,Negative
I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise. The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card. Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch. It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people don't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic.,Negative
"i returned it because it came dented.  I like it , wish i could have used it.  They said i got the last one.",Negative
"I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone. However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none. I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone. I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore. I tried it again to make sure it was the cover, and sure enough it did the same thing as before. I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2. So I had to return the case for a refund. It is disappointing because it was a great looking case.",Negative
"Not a very well made case, thought it would be of better quaility, hard to tell from just looking at it on the site.",Negative
"This product was pretty inexpensive so I had no expectations. When I received it I quickly noticed how flimsy the plastic was. You can probably fit 2 credit cards top. Might be a good case for nights out, but probably wont protect your phone much. I ended up tossing it because it was too flimsy.",Negative
"The case took almost a week to arrive. You buy a cheap case, you're going to get cheap case quality. Stay away. The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all. Will scratch your phone. Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt. Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case. Thank God it didn't scratch the aluminium on the case. A credit card didn't even slide all the way down into the case. Good luck trying to fit two in there. Spend your money else where.",Negative
"The phone does not fit into this junky case properly.  Completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller.  It was cheap with the coupon code because it doesn't fit!  I tossed this case is in the trash where it belongs.  I realize purchasing a cheap case is a gamble, but I never expected it be so bad that it doesn't even fit the phone. Completely useless.",Negative
"its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola. It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone, and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin's similar product from Walmart for $10 and it rocks.",Negative
"I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working! This thing is junk, there is no way to replace the fuse (if there is one) without destroying it. I tried to take it apart, but you can't without breaking it. If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it??? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone, that should tell you something! How do you screw one up?! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how!",Negative
"This is the 8th headset I have tried. Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone, but not so good on a cordless phone. Same with this set... Very comfortable to wear. I can hear those I call really well. Those that I call need to be able to hear me too! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried, but is still low. If you are talking to clients on the phone all day, this is important. I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume. Still looking.",Negative
"OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for :) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic,light weight and just down right worthless. the 2 weeks I had it pluged in,it never gave my phone a full charge,i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more,then you'll have to pay more.",Negative
"I like how it just barely sticks out from the cigarette plug on my Passat, so I can close the cover when I don't have my phone chord plugged in.Even on the 2.1 port, the charger cannot keep up with an iphone 5S. With every thing off on the iphone (air plane mode, screen off, etc), it gave a 15% charge in 2 hours. That's 7.5% per hour.When using Waze GPS the charge drops from 100% to 90% in 10 minutes.I would not recommend this charger.",Negative
"I can have this plugged in from Atlanta to Greensboro and the phone isn't much more charged than when I started.  But the phone doesn't die, either.",Negative

"I love my Kindle Fire, but I hate the micro plug.when plugging in a charger cord, I find that sometimes it doesn't recognize that the plug is in and sometimes I have to jiggle it a little to get the charging box to turn green to show that it is, in fact, charging. I cannot stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire. It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or don't work at all. Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge. I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I don't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart. I don't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord, they should all work. When I started using it, this cord ""appeared"" on my visual inspection to be well made, but I guess looks are deceiving. The cord, of course, fell apart after the return date so I'm stuck.I really don't recommend this cord. I realize that it could be just a single defective one,but, of the three other reviews, only one person out of four of us recommended this cord. So just beware.",Negative
"When I bought these, I thought they'd fast charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 2, but they don't.  They will slow charge.  I have tried multiple cables, including the original Samsung cable which allows for a fast charge, but found this didn't help.  Somewhere I read that they have to be specially configured to fast charge a Samsung device or otherwise they'll charge slowly despite which port of the charger you use.",Negative
"I had a previous version of this product a few years ago. It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out. You could see it through the translucent case. I like the previous version. This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have, so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx, the screen keyboard malfunctions. Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected. Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label. I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet. I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit. But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit.",Negative
"Bought this to use in our brand new 2014 Nissan Altima.  From the first time we plugged it in, it only worked if we jiggled it just right. Definitely not a 2.0 amp charger either.  Will spend the extra dough to get one directly from the T-Mobile retailer. Not worth the return shipping cost for a refund.  Only buy this if you feel like donating some money to a foreign company in Asia, just for fun.",Negative
"This case looks *FANTASTIC*, seriously. It's easily one of the classiest, most beautiful cases I've ever owned for a phone. The leather is great, it feels comfortable, it's just a seriously awesome case.The problem is, I want to use it as a basic wallet as well, and it fails miserably at that. The entire case is so tight you can hardly fit your cards in (I only want 3 cards and my drivers license. The fit is so tight you can barely get them in, once you do, the case doesn't close very well over the phone.I guess I could go back to a wallet, but I really didn't want to do that. I wanted to use this as a ""pick up my phone and my car keys and go"" arrangement. No more fumbling for wallet, but this cannot fit that bill. This case would have been far better off leaving all the extra storage out, and letting it close nicely. Overall, this case is wasted for me, just doesn't cut it, even though I so badly wanted it to.",Negative
"It is not leather, and its smell is atrocious. However, if you're okay with leatherette, it does have some nice pockets inside and it's relatively thin/lightweight.I'd avoid this seller though (BoxWave Corp). Shipping is $5 and you will pay to return the item to them. For me, it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth. I paid $30 for the case, $5 for shipping to me. I'll be sending it flat rate back. Bear Mountain cases are better, real leather, and cost less (about $20 for the iPad Mini).",Negative
This Classic Book iPhone case is flimsy and the cover will not remain closed. Not good protection for an iPhone.,Negative
"I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v. So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500. Received it July 11th. The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder. Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed. My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage (3 hours max in 7 days), but the headphone stopped working August 15. The person on the other line can hear me fine, but I don't hear anything from the headset. I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement, but Al from from customer service emailed me this, ""Unfortunately, more than 30 days have passed since you received this item, and we are not able to provide a replacement. Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order, you may return any merchandise in new condition, with the original packaging and accessories, or any defective merchandise, for a full a refund or replacement. "" Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation: 619-622-0764&lt;---this number does not work. So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund. As of August 17 12:54am EST, I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case. And for a good brand name like Jabra, I hope it is. But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment. I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced. Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects.",Negative
"Perhaps I just got a bad one, but this thing won't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone, let alone the 30 they claim. It's a nice design, and if it worked I'd be very happy with it.UPDATE: I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen (they even shipped out the new unit before I'd shipped back the bad one). Unfortunately, while the new unit works somewhat better, it still doesn't work as well as it should. For example, there is noticeable popping (interference) if i put my phone in my pocket, even on the same side as the headset. I've tried many combinations of phone and headset, and the only time I have problem is with this headset, so I'm quite sure it's not an issue with my phone, or with bluetooth in general. (In fact, I've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products.) So, the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works, but I've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE: I chucked it. Don't believe the breathless reviews about this. If you use this in everyday life--i.e. with the phone more than a few feet from your head--people on the other end will hear static. I got so sick of people asking me ""what's that clicking sound?"" that I threw the stupid thing away. I'm amazed people love this so much. They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they haven't actually tried using it for a real conversation, or they haven't actually tried to call another person. With two bad experiences with this company, that was the last Jabra product I'll ever buy.",Negative
"1st month, very good. 2nd month, dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me.  It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth.  It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me.  I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems.  Not worth it.",Negative
"First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter.  Worked fine, except that the vibrate feature won't work.  Then I exchanged it for another one.  This time the vibrate works, but the call pickup button would not work.  It works for power up/power down.  But I can't pickup any incoming calls.  The button simply wouldn't work for that functionality.  I tried it with few phones and it doesn't work.  I already exchanged the jabra adapter once.  Now I'm sick of exchanging it.  I think jabra has bad quality control.  Someone in the quality control shd be fired!  Everytime you exchange something, you run into a new problem.",Negative
"The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal (which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO).  Otherwise, it was horrific - static, terrible sound quality, etc.  Please do not waste money on that POS.  I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815.",Negative
"BT250 and this newer BT250v are pure junk.  The sound quality on these two units are horrid, there are no other ways to describe it.  My friends and coworkers can identify these units remotely and asked that I do not speak to them using the BT250 or BT250v.  The microphone is sooooo sensitive and un-tuned, it is particularly unusable in cars or while walking.  The road noise or wind noise will over saturate your voice.  Even under ideal quiet surrounding, normal speech will come out muddy and weak.  The battery life also shortens significantly during the  1 year warranty with moderate use.  The button on this unit doesn't help with usability.  With the earhook design, one would push the button in the direction perpendicular into the ear to activate the button, a task easily done with one finger and no pain.  However, this unit uses the behind the ear design, where you would have to use two fingers with a motion to pinch your earlobe to activate the button, it's truly an unpleasant experience.  In addition, the vibrate alert feature is just stupid and useless.  In most cases, one would be wearing this unit, so the audible ringing can be heard--why would you need it to vibrate???I truly advise against buying this unit.",Negative
"One of the most worthless items I've ever had.  No troubleshooting information in the manual.  Works when it wants as opposed to when I want.  Charge doesn't seem to last a day without any use.  Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.I give up on bluetooth.  And mostly, nomo MotoOne star because I can't give it a lower vote.",Negative
"I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset.  There were scratches on the front, and a small dent.  Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear.  I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money.",Negative
"I own this headset and the sound quality is very poor.  I end up having to pick up the handset manually so I can hear the person on the other end.  This defeats the purpose of hands free in a car.  In a quiet room it works fine.  Do not buy this if you intend to use it in a car, bus or train.",Negative
"As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user, I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850.  In fact, I went through FOUR HS850 headsets (under warranty) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 (despite the lower model number, the H700 is a newer model).The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics:- Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls (or put them on hold/mute)- Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat's the difference?  Well, ""good published"" battery life is the distinction.  All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months, but then would not hold a charge.  Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare.  Apparently, their support center for these products was in Argentina, and they could only do what was in their script to help me.  After the fourth failure, I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois.  That support contact was a dream.  After reviewing my case, he gave me the H700 as a replacement.  I had that headset for 1.5 years, and it had kept its battery life and functionality.  Of course, I lost it and had to buy a replacement...and given all the choices, I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850.  I've seen prices as low as $15 for this model.  I think you'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end.",Negative
"I have a Treo 650, on Sprint PCS, with a firmware update of 1.08For the most part, I actually like this headset because it is very comfy, and people seem to hear me well (the comfort is a big deal, as I often wear glasses)however, this headset takes a long time to connect with the T650 --- a good 7 to 10 seconds on most calls (and by then, most people have hung up)in addition, the volume is okay in the car (or other isolated places) but forget about using it outside or in noiser environmentsI've heard that it works well with Moto products though ---- for Treo 650 users, I highly recommend the Scala 500, which has fast connection times and loud volumehappy shopping!!!",Negative
"I love not having the wire, but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves (in echo). This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down, but then I can't hear the person I'm talking to either (unless I'm in a perfectly silent place). Other than this design flaw, the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls, good battery life, etc.",Negative
"I was very dissapointed with its audio performance. I don't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail(good microphone, quick connect, good battery life, light-weight etc.), but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line, if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment, you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy (this is at unit's highest volume). I was using this in the car, and I can hear faint at best when the road is good, but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway, the other person's voice is completely drowned. The speaker's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable. By the way, this experience was inside a luxury car, not a cardboard car. I am not sure the reason behind this design, could be to improve battery life?I had high expectations. I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 (read good reviews about it: in-ear position & USB charging).By the way, I used this with my Blackberry 7100g, good syncing and quick connection.",Negative
Sucks.... I want even keep this one. First it use a non usb charger and its too big and bulk this needs to put in the trashed and buried on another planet.,Negative
"I bought this headset to replace my HS820.  I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved, the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off. They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this. The contact with my ear wasn't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied.",Negative
"I like the look of this headset, and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However, the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset.  Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled, and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset.  Also, the earpiece speaker is not that loud, so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise (e.g., in the car).I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago.  I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one (Plantronics Voyager 510?).",Negative
"I had this bluetooth for a week, then I started having issues.  It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together.  In addition, it isn't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time.",Negative
"Hello, Since I am the tech guy at the homestead, I am not the user but hear everything wrong about something when I get it for my wife (sound familiar guys?) I bought this in spring 2012, she used it for two months and liked it and had no complaints about it, I was her hero! But by June it was dead-o-roonie and I was in the dog house again! Any-hoo I was asked to purchase again. I felt the Motorola name that came along with 900+ reviews was enough to make this a good purchase never mind the price under twenty bux? I know, I know, what do you expect for such a low price point? Alot, something that works for a year or more and it seems so did 900+ other buyers. Well, I am onto the Motorola H730, everyone is abuzzin' about that one also, and I will try it for my ever lovin', and see if I can be her hero again for a few months or more? I am quite sure this unit is out of warranty, but if any of you literature readers know about the warranty of this item. Post it here? Thanks in advance.",Negative
"The sound is horrible... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel. And I bought two, to have in case the BT ran down.... poor me..... And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too. No noise cancellation worth a d*mn... forget about using it when driving a car.... I am trying to find a new one...",Negative
"Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone, the ear bud is too big, uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear. After two weeks of use, the on/off switch stopped working, and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit. In sum, it was a waste of money. There was no provision in this review for ""0"" stars, so I gave it ""1""",Negative
"I don't see what others have liked about this.  It doesn't add any value -- doesn't make the phone easier to carry or use, doesn't add significant protection, or do anything else.  I'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip, that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband.",Negative
"This was my first clamshell phone, and I like that aspect of the phone, but that's about it.  It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones (all Nokia bar type) in the same coverage areas.  The biggest issue is definitely the battery.  I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days.  This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE.  I don't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds, but it is extremely frustrating.  Also, I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness (or lack thereof) of the menus, but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time.  I won't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS:POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS:Looks goodCompact",Negative

"****UPDATED on OCT. 18, 2010*sigh*I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle.  As previously speculated, I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit. I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that, more often than not, my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call.  My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden.  Maybe I didn't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and couldn't find one.  Maybe mine was defective, I'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth.  In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73% off but still $40 (orig $150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold) and it comes with its own chargeable case. Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges!  Other colors are a bit more. Check that one out if you wear glasses.  It fits into the ear, not over the top, so I am hoping for a better fit.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I was expecting more after reading the reviews.Let me first say that the sound quality is excellent.  Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality!  Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from ""all windows up"" and ""driver/passenger window down.""HOWEVER.... I wear glasses and have a rounder face.  It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on.  The bulky part doesn't sit well on my glasses' frame.  The mouthpiece is not adjustable.  I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face.  Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same.  The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving.  The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit.  I turn it on before I place it on my ear.  Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame. I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update.  If it doesn't work well for me I'm sure one of my kids will like it.  (I ended up returning it.  See above)Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place.",Negative
"This headset generally works, though there was times I needed to re-pair it. My problems with it that are:1) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough, but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2) It's big! It's comfy enough on your ear, but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it, its hard to get out of your pocket.3) Flashing blue light is way too bright! When is dark and I'm in the car, I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly. It disturbed my passengers too.4) Wind tolerance - it's better than my H700, but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I'm sending mine back and getting another H700.",Negative
"As many people complained, I found this headset's microphone was very weak. The other person can not hear me at all.  So I contacted Plaintronics for repair.  Their repair process has no tracking, just sending in your headset to an address.  Two weeks later, I received a used one back, not the one I sent in, packaged in an OEM box. Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in, it battery is not very reliable to hold charge, also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all.",Negative
"This is my second voyager 510.  The first one I had was great, but the charge wasn't lasting anymore, so I ordered this as a replacement....very disappointed with the clarity of the unit.  Lots of static in the background on my end.  People on other end don't seem to hear it, so I just deal with it.",Negative

"I had Jabra when it first came out, its battery stopped charging after 10 months. So I got this one as a replacement, it too stopped charging after a year. This is the problem with all BT earpieces, its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to. They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery. This kind of practice is not sustainable. I'm now back to the wired headset.",Negative
"I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone, and have been disappointed.1) Sound and voice quality are fine, but this thing is way too sensitive to wind.  I can't use it outside if there is any wind current, and even the air currents from my car's AC or heat are too much for it.2) Most disappointingly, the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days.  I am working with Plantronics' warranty department, but they need a ""date code,"" which is unreadable without a magnifying glass.  I will update once I have some resolution.3) This device only works for the Ericsson's phone functions, not music, because the Walkman music functions use the ""A2DP"" Bluetooth protocol, and the 510 is not A2DP compatible.  (Yes, listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame, but I would love to have podcasts on my phone).  For A2DP, you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4) Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't have any problem using this with glasses.  It's a little heavy, but basically fine.",Negative
"This was great for the first 2 months.  Month 3, it started dropping calls. By month 4, it was dropping more calls than it was answering.  I replaced it with another bluetooth, because I couldn't take it anymore.  I wouldn't recommend this.  I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks, no problems as of yet.",Negative
"i bought this one because of the excellent review, however, after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days, i'm quite disappointed.  The sound quality is ok, sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time.  i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one, and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this.  then there is the usability issue too, sometimes i hear the phone ringing, and pushed the button to accept the call and it wouldn't connect right away, had to wait several seconds to establish the link, the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem.",Negative
"I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to. Some heard the echo worse than the others, but all heard it. Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice. Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back!",Negative
"If you wear glasses most of the time like I do, this headset will not be comfortable for you. In fact, I couldn't keep it on without constantly adjusting it. So the sound was not good. I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset.",Negative
I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P. It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing. I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P!Caveat emptor!,Negative
"Unfortunately, I purchased mine when it was $100 and have never been able to use it.  I didn't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it, but have never been able to.  I can hear the other people, but they can't hear me.  No matter what I do, it won't unmute.  The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it's in your ear.  I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine.",Negative
"I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year (2007).  The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I've owned.

HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones. I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times. No results in replacement, return or refund. Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice. Very offensive and unprofessional. Needles to say, I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones.

I will try returning them for a replacement but I don't see why, as the design just isn't very smart with the headband cracking in the only place that is under stress.  They should have reinforced that one spot.It's a shame as the sound was really top notch and I used to be able to connect them to my ipod and leave it in my bag, or connect to my PC via 'bluetooth advanced audio' and not disturb my wife while I'm killing  zombies in Half-Life 2.",Negative

I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough, which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are. It is only a matter of time. Mine cracked within a week, and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful. Unless you have a really small head (maybe the size of a softball), don't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service, don't get it. it looks and sounds good otherwise, and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio (a2dp). it's a pity.",Negative

"I must have called Verizon ten times in four months, nagging them to offer the Treo 650 on their network. I almost deserted them to get the phone, but in mid-June, I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650. It has not been a great experience.First the positives. It is very cool to have all my contacts, all my appointments and todo items on my phone. While the phone is large by today's cell phone standards, it is a great looking unit and functions well. It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However, it is not all great news. First, I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook. I get duplicates by the tons and, worse, deleted contacts. The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with, but losing contacts, which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable. No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second, the reception and volume of the phone are horrible. Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas, the Treo is spotty inside my own house. I lose calls in transit and while sitting still. Worse, the volume is very faint. I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone, but distorts it as well. About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all, I'm disappointed in the Treo. It has some nice features, but it is very disappointing as a phone.",Negative
Crap do not buy will not work with any of the phones I have paid under four dollars.  I just trashed it,Negative

My friends kept asking me to repeat myself.  One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me (no lie).  I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity.  After that, I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $5 or so.",Negative
"Plug this in. Sometimes it connects; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine, but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone, it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back, but my total cost was only $3.My phone is an older Motorola v365, and I'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [Retail Packaging]. Maybe this can be an emergency backup.",Negative

"This model, the C250 EarWave Boom, is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered. I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used, however, all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality. With each one, the persons on the other end could not hear me. Disappointed. I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco, which has been the best so far.",Negative
"Bottom line: can't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear.  Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut.  The c200 worked well, but this c250 with the longer ""boom"" mic extension was not as loud.  Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day.  Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it.  I am not sure if my problem was unusual, but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss.  I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that.",Negative
"My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones. She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy, once you followed the written instructions. However, we've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions, and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work, the sound is pretty good. But most of the time, they don't work very well at all. And for the record, typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I've had the same problems when it's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try. Oh, it will call and we'll try to answer, and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us can't hear the other 99% of the time - at all. It's a series of ""hello-hello? HELLO?"" Forcing us to hangup and call again. Then we usually are connected.When we do connect, the sound typically has some static, minor digital echoing, and/or frequent dropouts such that you can't hear what the other party is saying. It's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an...it...sou...ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do. I've never had to adjust the volume buttons, but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button. When the headset is powered on, the button flashes. When you are actually using the headset (connected to a call) the button flashes faster. This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it's flashing. But it's always flashing! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and doesn't take it off very often, that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night. For a week, I drove home in the dark with my headset, and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye. But of course when I turned my head, it was gone. I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows! That can't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear. It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop. It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods. I know I've gone an entire week without recharging. The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I can't take this headset back, I'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it's design is to have a simple to operate, hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone. The BT350 simply doesn't meet any of those standards.",Negative
"(updated)+ Good battery life+ Very comfortable (choice of two ear bud tips, plus extras)+ Easy to use+ Minimal bling appeal (blue light is not obtrusive)- First unit failed (charger, headset buggy) after only 3 weeks use- Jabra Support is lackluster- Ugly shiny mic piece (photo on Amazon is not accurate, see customer images)After three weeks of use, it stopped charging from the AC adapter. It dropped audio connections while dialing, or after 20 minutes of conversation. (Replacement unit has also exhibited this, but less.) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue, they required that I a) return the headset under an RMA, and THEN they will b) send me a new one. After less than a month of use. I found another way to get a replacement (boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store.)On the plus side, it lasts on standby for a few days (vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does). It fits around my ear, and comfortably in my ear, very easily. The loop is soft rubber, so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear. If the sound is not quite loud enough (the volume controls are easy to find by touch, but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much), the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal, and is easier to hear this way. Sound is so-so, some callers have told me they can't hear me if there's ambient sound, music, wind, or cars nearby. In all, better than average, but this is the second Jabra product that's crapped out on me, so be wary. (I recommend always owning a wired headset as a backup, and particularly for business or important personal use.)** JULY 2008 UPDATE **I've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review. The unit has held up well (though the tip broke and had to be glued back). It still holds several hours charge, where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies. The shape, weight, and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I've had some companions remind me I'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call. Although I didn't like the shiny ""bling"" microphone tip, I've now softened on this design. The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others. Because I have a headset at work, and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature, I use this unit at home, and after two years, it still works great. I recommend this headset without reservation. (Disclosure: I use this with a Nokia 6682, and have not tested it with other phone models.)",Negative
"This earpiece was a great idea, but the main issue with it is that it has no noise reduction, and that it begins to crackle too easily when my arm or body part gets in between it and the phone. Some may say that's normal, but NO--there are plenty Motorolas and Sony-Erricsons that have stronger connectivity that don't crackle as easy when obstructed, so don't buy into that line.",Negative
"I used it for less than a week and charged it 3 times. On the fourth try the green light disappeared and it wouldn't turn on.I bought this because i loved the Jabra 250 and I still use it, as a matter of fact.I was just really disappointed that something like this (for the price I paid for it) would just stop working for no good reason.I should've bought the plantronics.Don't waste your money on this.",Negative
"I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I've had for almost two years now. Big disappointment. The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear. Also, people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable. I am going back to BestBuy to return it. Why pay $120 if there's no added value?!No doubt, it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate. I can tell you now - I ain't buying that one either.I guess it'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that's not static-y but I'm willing to wait.Roumen.",Negative
"I hate this phone...I was drawn to it by it's appearance and size but what a horrible dissapointment.  I had to get motorola mobile tools and 'hack' the volume so I could hear it - the loudest default setting is just too low. The display is impossible to see outside in bright light, I detest it that it has such a poor means of displaying missed calls, if the same caller has attempted to reach you multiple times, it displays the last call time only. I just returned this phone for a replacement because of dust under the display screen, I was told that it is a 'known' issue, but that my replacement phones warranty will expire this month at the same time as the original that I purchased.",Negative
"The Hype says:""Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular's GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service. When used with a Cingular data plan and the phone's Bluetooth or USB data capability, the phone can be used as a wireless modem for laptops and PDAs.""I say:CACA! If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it's the slowest, laggiest, painfully irritating, useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using! You could run to Seattle and knock on Amazon's front door faster than connecting to the site.Update: 6/7/2006I tested the actual bandwidth and I connect at 39.1 kbps, that's slower than dialup with a 56k (53.3) modem. When connected to Cingular's GSM it says connected at 115.2 kbps when I connect via bluetooth and 230 kbps when I use the USB cable. Either way the actual speed is 39-41 kbps and I surely don't have the patience for that.One last annoying feature ... Cingular ""brands"" their phones so you can't download games to your phone or delete certain ringtones etc., as you can with other providers. There is also an annoying ""HELLOMOTO"" video/commercial that uses 25% of your available space for videos of your own. There is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space.

"Like the previous Motorola phones that I've had, this one has the easy intutive system for navigating its numerous menus --- I'm sold on using Motorola for this reason,  compared to the Noxxxx, Motorola is great!PROS:Almost everythingAwesome designGSMI found the volume to be excellent compared to my last phone (motorola v60).Good antenna, extremely low rate of dropped signals --- also, since the antenna does not protrude, I anticipate it will not require replacement (I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 --- broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping)Excellent color screen.Good camera for a phone.Great size, easily fits in a shirt pocket.Great battery life (with Bluetooth off)Easily customizable but items that I never use (media mall, media net, etc.) remain in a prominent place and can not be put in some obscure location.CONS:The most significant negative feature is the screen --- it is extremely hard to see in sunlight.Display on front (when closed) is hard to read.Price (if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular --- they wanted $199) However, since I was changing from AT&T; to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $70.The manual that comes with it should be better writen.Screen gets oily from normal use and must be wiped off frequently.Alarm Clock interface could be better.Date Book Alert is not very loud.Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor --- two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable (had to buy one at Wal-Mart).Of the four or five phones that I have owned, this one is by far the best in all respects.  Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT: Change from 5 stars to 1 star...  I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great.  PROBLEM:  After about 3 months the screen would not light up --- took the phone back to AT&T; and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month --- took that one back, they sent another reconditioned phone,  Long story > short:  I had 5 phones in one year, the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years.

"10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller, lighter with great features but what's the point when you can't carry on a conversation? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area. I suffered thru AT&T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise. Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre. They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes. When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year. In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto.  I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i can't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people.",Negative
"The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had.  The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too.  Also beware of the so-called rebate.  If you don't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it, well go for it but if your time is money, run from this rebate and this phone.  5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool, hip cell phone.  How wrong we all were.  Cingular is fine.  They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us.  3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates.  The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops.  One mistake and you are screwed out of the $150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look.  All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise, but I feel that people should be aware that the cool, hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be.",Negative
This cable is ultra thin and must not be shielded well.  If I can't find the perfect spot to put my Ipod within the 2 foot circumference of the cable - then I get a ton of interference.  Even when I can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally.  I have another cable (non-retractable) that is only a foot long that works just fine - so I know the interference has something to do with this cable.,Negative
UPDATE:this silly 3.5mm cord lasted all of 3 months audio went out and the retractor went out very cheap quality would not buy this again went with the old standard non retractable cord,Negative
"I picked up one of these specifically for its ability to retract; it's quite fragile and flimsy, though, and within two days, it had broken and no longer retracts. It's fine as a cable so far, but now it has a heavy middle, which means if I drop it easily as I'm trying to plug it in, and have to go hunting for it between the seats.",Negative
"First of all, when I ordered this item the image showed it was WHITE not black. I ordered this specifically to match my white iPhone. Not only that the thing fell apart as I was taking it out of the box. I will be returning this garbage and getting my $5.00 back. Last time I ever purchase a Scosche product!",Negative
"This worked for about a week before it stopped staying put when you pulled both ends out. It kept retracting ad then finally just broke. Its a great idea, but this one sucks!",Negative
"I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer.",Negative
Seller lost this package at their facility and it took 2 months to receive it.  I bought it as a gift and i'm glad it took too long to get here. it's flimsy and gets really tangled really easy.  avoid at all costs.,Negative
I decided to return this product the moment I took it out of the box. It's cheaply made. My decision was cemented when it stopped working after one day of use.,Negative
It lasted me 2 days then it didnt charge I thought it was my battery but no it was the charger,Negative
"I'm really unimpressed with this headset. Granted, its a pretty old design now (i bought it in 2006) and I imagine there are much better headsets out there.There is way too much static for such a simple, digital device. It is especially bad if I have my phone in the opposite-side pocket as which ear I have the headset in.Certainly you can do better than this by now. Get something with a later bluetooth version.",Negative
"I bought the Plantronics 320 today. As soon as I walked out the store,the reception went static beyond belief. The salesman said ""Give it a chance"", I have and it's going back tomorrow. For the past week  I've bought 4 headsets(Motorola 500,850,700,& this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far.  Clear reception most of the time,excellent volume(no problem hearing while driving),& it always connected to my treo 650.  On a windy day my friend on the other end didn't even know I got out the car,hardly any background noise.  I just ordered the 700 through Amazon,much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola.",Negative
"I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others.  Well, it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for.  Let's consider the following in why I am returning this headset: pairing, sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use, but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it.  It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode.  After 4 attempts, I got it right.  My LG VX-9800(see my review)was able to pair with it easily after this.  However, it shouldn't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion.  With the speaker resting inside my ear, I didn't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called.  My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception.  When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 (out of 4), she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel.  Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem, but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired.  I would go to turn on the headset, but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected.  Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar ""Please say a command"" from my phone.  However, what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off.  I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions, but I kept getting ""Please say a command"".  Compare this to the Motorola HS850(see my review) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing, voice commands, and call connecting.  I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work, but this headset *still* frustrated me.  If you like things to work simply, this headset isn't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost; however, I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time.  The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear.  It is not removable, and try as I might to adjust it, I could not find a comfortable position.  The ear hook is also fairly rigid.  These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure.  On the box, it touts ""Comfort"" and ""Ease of Use"".  As you can see from my results, it doesn't deliver on either of these.  It's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price.  Unless you have the ear it was modeled after, though, I would not buy it.",Negative
"If this unit looks big in the photo, brace yourself: it's like a bad science fiction rocket ship when it arrives.  It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere.  It does not rest easily on the head.  It feels heavy and abrasive.  I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer, lighter material, or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head.  Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B, but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on.  Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter.  Motorola was ""kind"" enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number.  What a waste of time.  They either don't answer the hone, or leave you hanging for long periods of time on hold.",Negative
"I just got this from Amazon. I have a Treo700wx(sprint) and set up was a breeze and comfort of earpiece is excellent. However, I keep losing the connection between the 640 Headset and Treo. The Headset beeps in my ear everytime the connection is lost and it happens often.  I double checked the connection and everything is set up per the instructions.  Just wondering if I have a defective unit or if there is anyone else experiencing the same problems.",Negative
Fits my Galaxy Note 3 but just doesn't want to stay on the window...keeps falling off.  Not much good if it keeps falling off.,Negative
"This would be great product if it lived up to its specs.Pros:1.comfortable2.ease of use3.fantastic sound quality on both ends.Cons:1. Battery doesn't hold a charge2. 12V adapter seems to ""cook"" the battery.3. has a habit of dropping connection(I think this common to all BT devices)I'm currently on my second ""Road Warrior"" headset. The first one became extremely hot when charged with the 12V adapter plug & wouldn't hold a charge for over a few hours., I suspect that the truck voltage(14.1V) is too much for this little battery. I haven't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I don't want to fry the battery. The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery. This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal. The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours. Not even close. Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged. If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars, but with its poor battery life I only give it 2. If you can live with the battery issues its a great unit.",Negative
"Well, I have no idea what these sound like. They wont work on my phone! The connector is made ONLY for a Ericsson phone, which was NOT stated anywhere on the description. They were however cheap, so I really cant complain too much.",Negative
"I'm on my third z520a in the six months I've owned it.  The only reason I haven't gone through more is that I've accepted this phone is a lemon.  The phone freezes and can't be shut off, requiring removal of the battery to reset, frequently drops calls, doesn't always let me place calls, and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience.  What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive, model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on, not to mention the cost of accessories.  I'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product.",Negative
The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible. The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking. Now I press and press and nothing happens. It's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy. It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points.,Negative
The Goose neck is too hard to bend to shape and it doesn't stay put on the windshield very well either. I donated it to a local thrift store because it would have cost more to ship it back than the refund was worth.,Negative
"Great idea and design, not great execution and materials.It works good, but once mounted, almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism. You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work. When mounted, you can't tilt it, so it's a real hassle to open.I have mine set, and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city, to use my phone as a dash-cam. Eventually I'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it... It's great for that.It's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance, which means the ratchet action ceases to function. It's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy, or aren't built to spec in the first place.",Negative
"It even seemed flimsy at first and got stuck while we were trying to figure out how it worked. We did get it unstuck and we thought the problem was solved, but we were wrong.After using it for only a couple days it completely stuck and is no longer functional.  Pretty upset as my husband really wanted this for his work vehicle and now we have to go searching for another one and hopefully don't run into the same problem.",Negative
"I only purchased this phone because Cingular did not carry the new RAZR with the MP3 player and 1.3 megapizel camera so I had to settle for this one.  The swivel to use the keypad is awful, no one can ever hear me when talking, (even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset), photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here, can't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth, photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all, all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on, too bulky and heavy, battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use, reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas.  Overall, I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in.  I am a gadget junkie and the reviews on CNET led me to purchase this phone but I truly now regret it.  Go with the new Motorola RAZR with the 1.3 camera and the MP3 player, same features in a nice slim package.",Negative
"Everything works fine, but it can only sustain less than two days for very lightweight use (most of the time in standby status)I ordered two sony ericsson w600i from wirefly, they are bundled with cingular family share plan. Both phone are locked to cingular.Talked with sony ericsson support service, sony doubted it may be the problem of battery or phone and both of them.Talked with wirefly, they decided to exchange.",Negative
Case was garbage. What I got was not whats pictured. Also nothing lined up. Sent back promply. Would not purchase again.,Negative
"Watch out people -- the notched circular connection on these ear cushions does not fit the opening on a Plantronic Voyager Pro -- the diameter is too small, and they fall out. However I ordered the ""medium gel eartips"",Plantronics Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro [3 Pack] pack of 3, and the connector on those does fit. So I'm keeping the gel eartips (not this item) and throwing out these foam ones.",Negative
"It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people.  It never sat well on my ear, no matter how I adjusted it.  Luckily, it was less than $20, so no big loss.  I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola. The volume control was awful. It never seemed to make much of a difference.  I wouldn't recommend it at all.",Negative
"I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality.  When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background.  For the almost $50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth.  I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet, i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth.  I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear.  I drastically reduces background noise.Overall, I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price.",Negative
This item did not fit easily on the ear.  Earbud not designed properly.  I would not recommend this product. Also too bulky.,Negative
"I have no idea what they mean by ""Motorola Retail Packaging"", but beware it is not the same as the picture on the website.  I received this headset loose in a plastic bag, along with the instructions and the charger.  The charger had been ripped out of it's bag and used (the cord had obviously been re-wrapped and secured with a grocery store bag tie).When I complained to Amazon about receiving used merchandise, they immediately sent a replacement via overnight, but the customer service person could have cared a less as to why Amazon is selling used/returned merchandise.I just received the replacement today. While it doesn't look used, it too is just in a plastic baggie - no packaging like the webite shows.  I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife (to go with her pink Razr) - I'm sure she is going to be very impressed with the plastic baggie packaging.  I sure hope it works better than it looks!  Really bad, Amazon, really bad.",Negative
"I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews. I got it from Circuit City, so it's not a 'counterfeit'.  It pairs well with my Moto Q9C, and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it. The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise, and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable.  I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better.",Negative
I threw it out because of terrible Volume/clarity on both ends.  Go for the Scala 500- I just bought my second (lost my first) and it's the best on the market.,Negative
"The H700, some love it, some hate it. Wherever you fall, a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's /  CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face, your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as  up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small, multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey, they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise, echoes in rooms, and ""Who else is in the car with you ?""Headset volume is loud, louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging, pairing, standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'I am using a fancy headset dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market.  Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products.  I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls.  Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints.  Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.SUPPORT3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund, However the return shipping is ON YOU.  So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem. If its longer than 30 days, you are stuck with it.UPDATE 6/1/06Product was returned as defective and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx. 22 Days later I received it today 7/7, NOT NEW, just a refurbished headset. NO charger, manual, case, or  warranty card.UPDATE 11/18/06Died again. Will not pair, make, or answer a call. Motorola will not send a replacement until old one is received.  No free-shipping this time.BOTTOM LINEGoogle ""Motorola H700 problems"", make an informed decision.

"I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700. Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews, it seems that this headset works best with the razr. That being said, it does not work well with the v330. If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone, you get a ton of static. People tell me that I sound muffled when I'm talking to them. My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it.",Negative
It's didn't work for me r my phone its as a lot of mess on it I think this seller shouldn't have any more item on the best website I think,Negative
"This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design. I was quite pleased with the old one, until after about 2 years when it just died. That was 2 years of daily service, so not an issue. But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G, and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset, and not in the holster. The old one didn't have that problem.On the positive side, the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling, which is a good thing. They should all have that feature.",Negative
It got a lot of static noise. The connection was not good either. You have to put your phone within 6 inches away from the ear piece to get better reception. Regret for buying it. One useless item and money go down the drain.,Negative
"I love the size, form factor, and usability of this headset.  Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound.",Negative
I can hear people on it fine but have had nothing but complaints from friends.  I can't use it.,Negative
Reviews on this product were very good but there was one piece that would have likely broke easily per reviews and for this price point I decided to return it.,Negative

I got a defective purchase item here and am still awaiting the RMA from the seller.  Not really a comfortable product to wear.  Can't comment on the product as it has never worked to date.

"I upgraded from a Nokia 6600 (which I loved but it wasn't the hottest looking phone) and have also had the Motorola A630.  This phone is nice, dainty, and has a great display, but it ends there:*) The speaker isn't loud enough, so you're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still can't hear too well - I called T-Mobile, they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail.*) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open, many times you will actually reject a call.*) Using call waiting isn't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy, but retrieving a call is painful*) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first, slide the phone open, create a message, hit the enter key, then recent log, then select your recipients, then next then enter then the message sends.  On the nokia it was create the message, hit the green button, enter your destination, hit the green button.*) deleting messages is worse!  select the message, hit options, hit delete (sometimes it's 4, sometimes 6), ""are you sure"", hit yes, done.  On the nokia, select the message and hit ""c"" and you were instantly done.*) bluetooth - it's supposed to be convenient, but NO, you are always asked if you want to connect - there is no such thing as auto-connect!  every time I get in my car I have to get the phone out of my pocket and unlock the phone, then hit yes, or I'll be nagged every few seconds by a noise.  Oh, and if I hit NO (when someone else is in the car and I don't want calls going to the car) it'll ask me again in about 5 seconds.  ARRRGH!This baby is going back!

"July 2007:Great form factor, mediocre features, weak Mac supportForm:As an exclusive candybar user (Nokia & Sony-Ericsson, both high end and mid range) I was trepidatious of using a slider. In lieu of a decent, nonflip, bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone. Friends and strangers alike say: ooh how pretty. I say ...Pros:1. 1.3 Mp camera2. Bluetooth3. most vivid clear screen I've seen on a cell4. good form factor5. opens & closes very well well (1st edition I had was a little clunky, had a Samsung China sticker on the inside, 2nd edition I had (replaced due to bad mic) doesn't have a manufacturer's tag)6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 (w/ Tmo)7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone's camera - good times! This little feature is silly, but makes me smile so much; if all features of the phone made me smile like this, I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no ""favorites/shortcuts""- soft keys cannot be changed- cannot use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones (on 1st handset (which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem) I could, on 2nd handset, this functionality was gone! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them, whatevs Tmo!)2. lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls (cannot text or surf during calls)- no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync (although, you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book (Menu: Card > Send card) via Bluetooth, which is at least some convenience, but not the convenience of iSync)- - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable (despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I don't believe)- - Bluetooth (via my Mac) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell, eg, sees pics only in the memory card3. GUI isn't well thought out - menu navigation difficult, sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done (sending a text to multiple people is a major chore), finding files is not intuitive, submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps (compare to the ""File"" menu on all Windows programs, it's the same because it makes thins easier, Samsung hasn't figured this little design STANDARD out)4. 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF?!?5. problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted, aftermarket purchased card (necessary for music or multiple pics) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again. My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac, Windows, or Linux; currently the one I have is a Mac. Hello: Mac, Samsung, communitcate!! My previous phone, the SE T610, synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac. The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync. Don't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync's with Macs.Every single Samsung product (phones, home entertainment, etc) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features. However, each was loaded with glitches. No more Samsung for me!Wish I had gotten a RAZR (free or nearly so with Tmo), held out for a Motorola Capri, or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia (every one I've had has been outstanding).UPDATE as of November 2006:The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed. After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket, squatting down while painting and standing back up, the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker. I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS! the inside/backside screen was cracked (the one inside the casing I guess) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty doesn't apply to cracked screens. Tmo sent me a replacement, but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $150 for this irritation phone.",Negative
"It looks very sweet.  Awesome screen and speakers.  Some decent hacks for it on howardforums dot com!  It's battery life is almost pathetic though.  It's reception is poor.  The big exposed screen is also prone to scratching, and getting dust/dirt under it.  You also can't use mp3's for ringtones without hacking/cheating it.  Rename mp3 to 3gp, copy to micro-sd, then copy back to phone memory.What really killed the deal for me was the reception though.  Had a Nokia 3650, awsome, even worked ok in my basement, next a Moto V330, barely worked upstairs, just bought 2 of these T809's and they won't even recieve good enough to let me setup my voice mail in my livingroom.  Called T-Mobile support..  They are putting in a request to point an antenna towards my house.  I'm request #2.  I wish they just sold a decent Nokia.  Using the phone outside is going to get old once it starts snowing here in Michigan.Bottom line: If you just want a sweet looking phone this is it.  If you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere.  This is like the RAZR's.  Form over function.  T-Mobile used to have lots of sweet Nokias, then they went to so-so Motorolas, now they are pushing Samdung and whatever is cheap.  Not a good thing.  -  Joe",Negative
"Beware!!  I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola, to get the nifty purple color that's offered only on their website.  Bad, bad, bad idea.  About a month after I bought it, the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly, screen going dim, etc.  I mailed it in (the problem later turned out to be the SIM card), and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here!!  I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone, to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot, and the last thing I need is paying Cingular's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number.  And waited on hold.  And waited.  And waited.  And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call.  Well, that was the first call.  After a week of no return call, I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times, with an average of 45 minutes' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, using Motorola's Chicago business address as the complainant.  FINALLY someone called me back, and - a miracle!  I got a new phone!However, the story doesn't end here.  I mailed back the old phone per the instructions, and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back.  There's nothing wrong with it, except that it's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range, and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time.  That said, you can't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it, and you can't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago.  I'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling, but if I were you I'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty.",Negative
"I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip, it's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus doesn't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4.  Very poor design on Belkin's part.",Negative

"Don't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back. What I mean by that is that when your on the phone, the other party hears an echo.  This happend on all the calls. The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box!  I don't recomend wasting your money on this. One you may try that has worked for me is the H500.  Cheap looks ok and best of all, it works!!!!  Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3.",Negative
"I bought this direct from Amazon, and their ""unlocked"" phone is technically unlocked, but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that, ""branded"" is a euphemism for ""hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff.""  I guess ""branded"" is shorter than saying all that.This is not a ""clean"" L7.  You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone, although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant ""permission"", while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate.",Negative
"Pouch felt clumsy. There was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in. Also the clip is so thin that it's not good with sweatpants or scrubs. With the weight of the phone, it will flip over if it's not clipped onto a belt.",Negative
"I've owned two of these. It is great that it rests against your ear, and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear. The first one I owned, after a month, lost most of its volume. I could not make the volume louder via the volume control; the volume control actually never seemed to work, but at least at first the volume was real good...for about a month. The second one I bought lasted about 9 months, but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work.",Negative
The first headset I was sent was DOA.  I was told to pay the return shipping and a replacement unit would be sent out.  I did that and received another unit and guess what.....

"this bluetooth headset is probably one of the worst you can ever waste money on.For some odd reason all of my motorola bluetooth, including this one has really really bad static.I cannot clearly hear the other person and the other person cannot hear me.I would save my money and buy a different brand altogether.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset",Negative
"The H700, some love it, some hate it. Wherever you fall, a lot of people are talking about it.PRO's / CON'sIt is comfortable and light. / Depending on the size of your face, your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125. / Other phones and PDA's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small, multifunction (each button does may things) and are easy to access but hey, they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise, echoes in rooms, and ""Who else is in the car with you ?""Headset volume is loud, louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status (charging, pairing, standby etc) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'dork lamp' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1. This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions (Version A and Version B) of this headset in the market. Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2. Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products. I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones (Razr V3 and 8125) twice with no improvement. Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls. Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints. Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but nothing past 15 feet.3. Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund, However the return shipping is ON YOU. So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $5 even if its their problem, and there are problems with this headset.If its longer than 30 days, you are stuck with it.I would give it 5 stars for Style, 3 stars for execution, 2 stars for how well it works, and 1 star for their support policy.Google ""Motorola H700 problems"", make an informed decision. If you can, try before you buy. $100 May Not buy you the best, maybe just the smallest. I am waiting on Motorola to replace it one last time.UPDATEProduct was returned and received by Motorola 6/15. A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx.22 Days later I received it today 7/7, just the headset. NO charger, manual, case, or  warranty card.Dead as a door nail with no charger to check it.  After 30 minutes on hold they will now replace the Whole product as ordered and returned #98686H. Would not refund shipping charges.  For those contemplating a replacement make sure they send out the latest headset part # SYN1311B.Remember a company is as the sum of its parts, support 0 stars.",Negative
"I saw the reviews for this headset on CNET, and I was pretty excited about getting it to use with my LG VX-9400 phone.  The Verizon sales agent recommended it to me because they H700 had the same version of bluetooth.  That was the reason she gave for my Jabra BT350v having lots of static when using with the 9400.Well, the results with the H700 were actually worse.  The callers on the other end said that the static was painful to their ears it was so bad.  I heard some static on my end which has never been the case with any headset phone pairing that I've had.  After one day, I boxed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.One thing to note.  This must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with.  If you are not using the LG VX-9400, your experience will likely be different.  If at all possible, find a headset that others have already used with your phone and have reported success with.  Otherwise you are rolling the dice.  Sites like Howard Forums (Google it) are good for finding out what others have experienced.  Good luck!",Negative
I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji. While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof' case. The case was sitting between my legs and during the trip out it slid into some water. The water was maybe 2&#34; deep. It didn't even completely submerge the case. Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort. When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation. There is no place to find another camera. I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!,Negative
"Great interface, but the pen is faulty. I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use. The pen for the mda doesn't work sometimes and it's operation isn't smooth. The screen isn't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool doesn't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs, that wasn't good. i like my business tool silent when I am at home. And it is locked by T-mobile such that you can't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it, for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I didn't get that feel at all.",Negative
"The MDA, designed and made by Taiwan's HTC, a leader in the Windows Mobile ""smart phone"" market (they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S.), is really a cool concept.  It has a nice shape, a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape, and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile: Pocket Office, Pocket IE, MSN Messenger, Windows Media Player 10, and tons of free software to download from the web.  Plus, it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA, as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook (problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 ""Cobalt"").  And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year, not two-year, contract (and still gives you a rebate).  Anyway, after a few days I was sorely disappointed.  The problem lay entirely with the MDA's reception.  It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003.  The MDA's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable.  And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal.  It was frustrating to no end, even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception.  I never got half the speed promised by EDGE, the 2.5G GSM data network.  Very, very disappointing.  Much, much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary: the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning.  It's a dud, thanks partly to HTC's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile's poor EDGE and GPRS support.  If you can stand a two-year commitment, go with Sprint's PPC-6700, also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design.  I haven't tried the PPC-6700 yet (cuz I'm pretty much broke now), but online reviews are mostly positive.",Negative

"I'd like to say I was satisfied with this device, but I'm not, the ATT version for whatever reason was just SOOO much better than this phone on TracFone, and it was basically the same phone.Just a stupid phone!!!THE ATT VERSION IS GOOD, BUT THIS IS A NO GOOD PHONE!!Hello guys, up for reviews today is a phone I once used for tracfone the motorola c139.1st phone, it worked good, i was in the bathroom flushed the toilet and down went the phone, of course it was dead after this and it was gone to the sewer.2nd phone. Had this phone with at&t; service, instead of tracfone, I noticed a possible ui change, better service and the fact you could use this as prepaid or personal because AT&T; does not put a sim lock on pay as you go sim cards.The phone wasn't that good for texting but it was pretty good also for just the games, I got addicted to the one where there is the ball and it is kind of like brick attack, found on most keyocera phones, but i totally forget the name.3rd phone, was tracfone i got it for my sister, it was washed in the hose, fell and got sprayed an a red dot to prove this. got the screen to change colors and call different people from her contacts, tried drying and then it stopped even working as even a phone, it would go to the tracfone turn on screen reset itself and do it again until you did something like press a button itd go off, or the battery would die.it still mysteriously charged, so it was used for a moto charger, or planned to if i found a phone with the same battery and then all now i get was a lit up keypad. i took it apart, which voided the warranty, if any since wet. now all i got was nothing and figured i should replace it and recycle it which i did.",Negative
"Beware Tracfone. I regret that Amazon won't let me give them 0 stars. We got this phone for my wife's aunt last December. After 1 year of trying to get this working, she still cannot receive calls. She can call out, but no one can call her. Tracfone support is useless (and generally only marginally speaks English). You also cannot manage the phone or minutes on line. You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything. We're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless. Coverage isn't good either, but who cares if you can't receive calls anyway? There has got to be a better option, because I doubt there are many worse ones.",Negative

The bottom developed a hole after extremely light use.  The cost?  A ruined iPhone 5s.  What a nightmare.

"Bought my cable last year and only used it for a couple of weeks before I decided to replace it with a cable from Nokia.This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material. Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in, still doesn't work a lot of times. So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.Yes the price is low. But overall the item is too unstable.",Negative
"This cable functions fine (at first), but it probably won't hold up to everyday use.  I've inserted mine maybe 20 times, and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck, making the cable worthless.  Sure it's dirt cheap, which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable, but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping, I'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items.  I'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty.",Negative
"I should have paid more attention to the reviews.  I went ahead and ordered these, mostly due to price - nowhere can you find wireless stereo headphones for $35!  There's a reason, though.  After wearing them for only 30 minutes, my ears were very sore.  No way of adjusting them.  Sound is pretty good, but certainly can't overcome the discomfort.  Will be returning for credit.",Negative
"I came across David Pogue's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned. Compared to the other's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime. I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house. The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile' to operate with the Jabra as a music player. Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i couldn't use the headsets for music was disappointing. As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece. I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design. After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC. However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers wouldn't work on either application. The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer. On the plus side the headphones are well made (for the price), comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who aren't audiophiles. The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up (15 feet seems to be the max)and on a minor note the flashing LED's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device. Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but. What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology. I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer.",Negative
"Looks very cool.  Very convenient charging via USB port.  Not so good sound quality.  Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars.  Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510, so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews.  Other may have a great experience with this earpiece.  Unfortunately, I am not one of them.  Maybe I got a ""bad"" one.",Negative
"The sound quality in the car is great.  The callers often complain that they can't understand me despite talking directly into the mic.The thing that makes this unuseable is that it often links to my phone but doesn't actually connect.  I may or may not hear it ringing when I make a call... and, even though I am connected to the device, when the caller answers, we can't hear each other....it isn't really connected.so, this is useless",Negative

"Don't buy this adapter!!  The picture shown is not what you will receive, the picture shows a genuine Nokia adapter but what you get is a cheap piece of crap that doesn't even have the same specifications as the Nokia adapter. So if you don't want to fry your device, don't buy this.",Negative
"I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q. This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal. We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives, the Verizon system is ""spoofing"" the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server. These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to ""white list"" (unblock) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server, their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent. This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I don't blame them for this. I'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address, messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct ""From"" and ""Reply-to"" addresses, with the first being any external Verizon wireless address, and the latter being the customer's desired and commonly used email address. The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender won't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device, we advise against purchase and don't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both ""From"" and ""Reply-to"" fields configurable. Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably won't have problems like this.",Negative
"I will be reluctantly getting my 3rd Q (replacement). I've only had this 2nd one for maybe 2 months.

"Phone Experience:Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone, charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone. This is slow and very limited capabilities. Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience:At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular. Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are: Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee, so your first month with activation will cost $250-300 excluding phone cost. Next, they charged me $15 because I ported my old number, in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience:The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone, with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes. I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon, they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement. I went to store, the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha, who don't know on this earth that Amazon don't care for customer satisfaction at all. There is no one who can help you. After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I shouldn't have bought it from here, if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents don't buy from here, its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term.",Negative
"Overall this is a bad phone. The main reason I purchased it was because it's very thin and has no antenna. The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways. This is where the positives stop. The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life. I have even disabled EVDO so it won't switch between it and 1x when moving around town (which drains the battery).The Verizon software makes the phone useless. You cannot have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time, you cannot change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD, and you cannot change the color scheme from red. Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool, which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone. You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service. Even if you wouldn't normally use media on your phone, you should object to this because of principal. It's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera, but it's functionality is limited. It takes video clips, but nothing over 15 seconds. There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone, but it's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses: very thin, no antenna, sleek designCons: horrible user interface, very few options to change the appearance, many of the phone's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion: buy something else. I succumbed to the hype of the Razr, but was burned. If it weren't for Verizon, the phone would be fine.",Negative
I BOUGHT TWO JUST TO HAVE ONE CHARGING WHILE I USE THE OTHER ONE.BIG MISTAKE!!!  BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONSIT WORKS OK JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS.,Negative
"I first liked this headset when I got it because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook. They are reasonably loud and easy to use (volume, On/Off & paring). Charging is simple: drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first, it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear (hardly cool) or risk it getting lost in a purse. And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case (slips out).The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip (does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs)But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT&T; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again. When you are driving and expecting a hands-free ride, this is a pretty serious problem.So I am replacing it and hoping that Samsung has addressed these problems with the well-reviewed WEP470.",Negative
Keeps flling off ear. does not work past 4 feet. Bought the Jabra 125 and love it,Negative
This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large.  It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear.  The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging.  The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers.,Negative
The sound garbles badly and the battery runs out within an hour. Very neat looking headset but not functional.,Negative
"After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine, I thought I'd purchase a cheap $20 replacement.  The Plantronics Voyager 510 was a little large but I was always satisfied with the voice quality and fit on my ear.  The Samsung WEP200 does not compare in function to the Voyager 510.  I never could get it to attach to my ear and stay there.  Nor was the sound quality very good.  Overall, Samsung makes great LCD TVs and decent printers.  This device, like their Blu-Ray players, is lacking in function and performance.  I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will buy another Voyager 510.",Negative

"First, the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on. Hmm, OK, I'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous ""one button wonder"" I disconnected or worse, couldn't hear it loud enough. for whatever Allen Funt reason, this !#!@?!! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself. It doesn't fit into my ear(s) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right. Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself: distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product, but gone, darn it. As such, I've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it.",Negative
"I bought this headset on the recommendation of a very picky friend, so I figured it would be great. Wrong. The ear loop is cumbersome to put on, and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear. Worse, you have to place the headset in a recharging box (???? What happened to a simple plug??), meaning that the ear loop needs to come off. A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge. The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low, necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage, even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia. To be fair, the sound quality was reported to to be very good, but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses.",Negative
"Ok, seriously, who are the group of dolts at Samsung approving the release of a products like this?  Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear?  I'm writing this because they are making newer models, but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect, it's the design.  I have no idea who's ear this is designed for, but it's not for humans.  You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring, that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone.  Not even close.The size is appealing, and the storage case charger is great.  It does work well, low noise, and good range.  However, it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge.  But, if you have to balance it in your ear, and keep still, or hold it, it kinda defeats the purpose.  It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went, and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So, the cheap, flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap.  Plus, there is no place to put it.  The headset goes in it's case, but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where, exactly?  Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out.  That must be where mine is, because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes.  They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear, or maybe to floss your teeth.  Who knows.  They do nothing, and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you don't use any of the included attachments... but it hurts either way.  I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers.  One set were foam-like wraps... useless.  And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset (Silver)is the newer model, but it is not any different in design.  However, it's so cheap with rebate, it cost less than the freakin' earbud covers I wasted money on.  Therefore, after this appealing review, and you still want to buy this thing, I would go for the newer one.  But, don't say I (we!) didn't warn you!NOTE: If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached, please disregard this review.",Negative
"Ordered this thing on Sep 19th.  It did not ship until Oct 26th!  And don't even get me started about the stupid reasons customer service gave as to why an In STOCK item took that long to ship.  Anyway, I finally got it.  I was so excited because of the great reviews I read.  When I saw the ear hook, I was like WHAT!  This is a flimsy piece of cr@p!  I thought to myself, ""This is going to break as soon as I use it, so I had better just leave it on.""  Then to my utter AMAZEMENT!  YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF TO CHARGE THE DUMB THING!  After the second charge, guess what?  IT BROKE!  Big surprise!  Now I have to hold the unit to my ear to use it, or if will fall out.  Not that the ear hook was all that great, the thing still fell off even when it had the ear hook.  I can't really comment about how well the thing works, because I can't keep it charged.  After the first complete charge, it died after one phone call.  It was about an hour phone call, but gee whiz!  This is my 5th bluetooth ear piece, so I have a little experience with these things.  My biggest complaint with the others was low speaker volume and noise interference.  I wish I would have had the chance to test this one out but it's going back to Amazon.  Maybe I should file an RMA and then wait a month and a half to ship it back to them. LOL!",Negative
this thing isn't comfortable at all...and doesn't stay on my ear worth a darn.It has good connection quality...but I can barely use it.,Negative
"This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset.  Every time I put the headset in the case, the case squeezes the activation button on the headset.  Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface.",Negative
"I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets. After the first one expired--largely due to the inability to recharge, brought on by exposure to pockets, etc.--I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got. At first, the case seemed to be a godsend. It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly. Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly. I figured I'd be careful enough and kept the case. While packing boxes for moving, I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset. By the time I realized what happened, all the boxes were packed, sealed and ready to go to storage. It's not as bad as losing the set on a street, but, still, I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked. Luckily, the price dripped from $80+ for the headset to around $30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement. But I am not putting it into the case--it's safer in my pocket.",Negative
"I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset.  It fits the headset very nicely, but..  But, the design of the case does not prevent the  multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed, even though there is a recess in the case cover you'd think would prevent that.  The result is that I'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket, it might be ok, though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button.  If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse, then you should probably reconsider.",Negative
"This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone.  The sound quality is as good as other headsets I've used, and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer.  However, I'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been.  I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time.  I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset.",Negative
"Well, I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price. It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset. Thankfully, it wasn't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me. I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person cannot hear me properly. I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear. I don't care about it otherwise.",Negative
Did not work well with my phone.,Negative
This bluetooth was my first and worst. I couldn't hear alot on it and it didn't stay on my ear for nothing. I would stay away.,Negative
"I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone. Unfortunately I misplaced it. So I eventually bought another one via Amazon. When I got it, it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound. I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away. It did not. This was suppose to be a brand new headset. It's defective and I did not return it immediately. So I'm giving this supplier a 1 star.",Negative
"Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset. Worked ok but, paired fast. Volume was ok but could have been louder. Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside' voice which is annoying to others around you. The other complaint is the fit. I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design. It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does. Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased. Here is where I am at currently with headsets....this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far. I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola. I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off...and on occasions it has. I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously. To replace it, I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010. Great headset, so good, my wife stole it. Went to buy another and the price had gone back up. I tend to lose or damage things, so I have set a budget of no more than $30-$40. I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020. I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back. Again, went to buy another and the price had gone up. This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off, the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had. I can honestly say, I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in. After 5-10 minutes, you dont even notice it on at all. Extremely light weight. A 5 star in my book. Where as, the motorola is a 1 star, the BT5010 is a 3 star, and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use. I like the placement of buttons. The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and doesn't leave you guessing. The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter. Pressing the dial in also has function as well. Neat, simple design and easy to access with larger fingers. Again, 5 star.Finally is funtionality. This is where I have to question my rating. I know this is not a $50 headset, $75 headset, or even a $100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such. I understand you get what you pay for. With that said, here is my humble opinion. The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself. However, the range is not as good at the others I have used. The Headset operates best with the phone in sight. Static is noticed by the caller (not me) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other. In the car, it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat. If you want to use it in the left ear, the phone should be on that side. Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller. Call quality is always good on my end, however again, the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo. Again, I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect. But, no caller has complained when asked. Some didn't even know I was on a headset. Background noise is an issue for the caller though. One does need to close the windows, turn down/off the radio, lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function. The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones. Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone, I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings. The Jabra's were good, but voice recognition, redialing, and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up. That means, if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected, you had to find the phone and manually use it. Not bad if it is seldom used. As for me, I use each phone equally. This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone. Great feature that allows full function use of each phone. The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active' at a time on the headset. Meaning, if you are talking on phone 'A' and then hang up...minutes later phone 'B' rings, you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate. Then, once you hear the other phone ring, you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B'. A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones. In the Jabra's, the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything (great), but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories. It come in the box with a wall charger, car charger, usb charger, and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion, great headset for $30. In that price range (under $50??) it is a 5 star. Is there better out there. Certainly. But you have to double, if not, triple the price. For $30.00, I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others.",Negative
"It acted as thought it was muted when it wasn't. I tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones. The person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it. I did try to turn the mute off, all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard.",Negative
"While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit.  If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times.....  but if you want to turn it off, thats a whole different story.  Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it.  Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function.  I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device.  The button is also entirely too sensitive.  I've had the device in my cargo pants pocket (where this would be very little pressure on the device) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.Other issues are the charging indication isn't real clear and there isn't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device isn't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used (its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money).",Negative
"It fits the phone, but has a crappy, cheap feel to it.  It collects fingerprints and doesn't seem to do anything but add bulk to an already large phone.",Negative
"This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .",Negative
"I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car.  Boy, was I disappointed.  Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end, but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well, even without the ear loop -- just the eargel.  BUT...The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket, bag, or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger.  If I have it clipped on my pocket, the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position.  When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out.  I've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism, and/or have the eargel facing back when it's in the clip in a pocket so it won't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons.  I never used the volume controls (always did it from the phone), and I dreaded getting calls because I'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It's always getting ""unpaired"" from my Treo 680.  I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again.  To be honest, this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset, but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality, slightly lighter force on the buttons, but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket.--- UPDATE ---I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels.  So I'm using it again.",Negative
I thought this thing would be great because it was so small and I could use my normal chargers with it but it broke soon after I bought it.,Negative
"Product came without shipping slip, no protective packaging. .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag, slipped in an envelope and mailed.  Quality is very poor.  Crackling, buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it.  I would not recomend this vendor to anyone.  Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items.  This came with bluetooth only and charge cord; no instruction or any other accessories with this.",Negative
"Although weight, sound and battery are good, I really dislike this headset's design. If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs, it's ok. If you are on the go, the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag. The pen holder doesn't do anything to shield the clip, in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset. I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose. The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason. Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device, you must now haul this cap everywhere. Hey, I don't always wear a shirt with pockets. After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector. There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions, but watch this company do it over again.(several months later) I finally am tossing out this headset. The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device. I don't like to get rid of working items, but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time, they fell elsewhere and are lost. Would you believe it couldn't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat? I did get a box to carry it in, but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder, and now it doesn't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece. Just ordered a Motorola H500, lower cost, lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack. I got a travel case for less than $4. Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset.",Negative
"The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on.  I had to send the first one back because it wouldn't turn off.  I have the replacement, and still have the ear hook issue, and it doesn't stay in my ear without it.  I'll be buying another bluetooth, but this will do for the time between ordering.",Negative
"The sound is horrible in the car.  My fiancee said that it sounded like there were bubbling noises when I was talking to her via the headset.  So I called my home and left a message on my answering machine.  Horrible!  I could hardly hear myself over what sounded like bubbles in a fish tank.  Garbage.  Your mileage may vary, but I would highly recommend you consider a different headset.",Negative
"I am replacing this headset (It replaced an Explorer 320) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics. Their recommendation? Replace the headset. I ordered my 510 tonight-can't wait to replace this one. Note-it drops calls frequently, which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too. But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous. I could have bought a 520 for $2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL!",Negative
"I really don't have a lot of time. That is why I shop online, So if I'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient, like a Bluetooth headset, it really is obnoxious to receive one that is &#34;worse than sucks&#34;. This item did not even charge. Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale. I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior, I've always had luck with Plantronics. Too bad that this one was a lemon.",Negative
The sound quality is fine... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket. This thing has NO range to it. It's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design. The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive. All the design in the world doesn't mean a lick if it just doesn't work.,Negative
This product is junk. Had it less than a month and it stopped working. Dont waste your money.,Negative
"The  sound  was  great,  but  the headphones  were  poorly  constructed  and they  broke. The  headphones  have a  really  annoying &#34;police like&#34;  blue  light.  The  light  disturbed  others  around me.",Negative
"I bought the 590's because they're one of the few bluetooth stereo headphones that get overall good reviews, both at Amazon and tech websites like CNET.  I've had mine for about a week.  I want to use them for music listening and Skype calls through my computer.So far I can only get them to work as stereo headphones.  In that respect, they sound very good.However, I'm unable to get them working as a phone headset with my computer.  The problem is the microphone.  When I try Skype's test call, I can hear the lady speak, but Skype cannot hear me speak.On my Windows XP laptop, I can connect the 590's as  'stereo headphones' or as a 'hands free headset with microphone'.  After connecting as a headset, I hear odd beeps about every 5 seconds.  The beep pattern is not described in Plantronics' skimpy User's Manual.I've configured my computer's sound system to use bluetooth for playing and recording audio.  I've tried pressing the 590's Phone and Mute buttons to unmute the microphone, but nothing seems to work.I'll call their support number to try and make the 590's work for Skype calls.  I hope they work out, because they're light and sound great.",Negative
"Very flimsy, cheap product.  Takes 8 seconds MINIMUM to turn On/Off.  Battery life only a couple days.  I sure expected better from the previous reviews.",Negative
"I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile (VM) customer for several years, happily using an Audiovox 8500.  VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM.  I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone.  I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get.  It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception, but the outgoing voice quality is below average.  The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking.  Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character.  If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S.  You will feel compelled to purchase additional ""wallpaper"" for an additional $2, because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly!",Negative
"Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item.  The phone is thin, but the call quality is quite poor.  Virgin Mobile uses Sprint's PCS network, and Sprint is my primary provider (I have a new Sanyo M1 phone), and the call quality difference is huge.  The keypad is also uncomfortable to use, like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO.  Finally, VM's prepaid rate is just too high.  Coupled with limited coverage, I'd say VM's service is a bad deal.",Negative
"This charger, just wouldn't charge... probably it was not chosen well, but at most....could have been used as was anticipated........",Negative
When it arrived I went to plug it in and noticed one of the prongs was bent. I went to bend it back and it broke! Then I noticed rust at the base of the broken prong. I'm sending it back for a refund and won't be buying another one.,Negative
Does not work with iPhone 3GS at all. First time I tried it it said Accessory not optimized for iPhone. I think Amazon should remove the listing.,Negative
DO NOT buy this charger. You will probably never see this review because nobody wants you to know what this charger will do to your Apple device!! It will destroy it!,Negative
Do you have some money to waste? Buy this item. It is broken at 2nd day of use and does not stand phone. I rated 1 star because there is not less,Negative
"I cant say how yours is going to hold up but the one that I purchased did not hold up. The first day , the first time that I put this on my belt and went to sit in my car, it broke. The belt clip shattered into millions of pieces. The only thing that is of use and that is why I at least gave it 2 stars was the case itself. It is of the best that I have seen yet. High quality looks and feel.and the ergonomics are very good too. It just feels good. The problem is, that I wanted a holster with the case and if the clip breaking off is any indication to the rest of the quality on down the road than just get something else.",Negative
"Thin materiel would not last long, inexpensive looking. Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad, returned item.",Negative
I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this item in white.....it was discolored within one week of purchase. This case was discolored very quick just from normal use.,Negative
Case did not protect the front of the phone and it made the back square instead of rounded fits in holster well but I did not like the feel on the phone I sent it back,Negative
This only last one week....The belt clip is made from a cheap plastic...! I like the kick stand to watch movies but that is it....Do not buy....D,Negative
These do not work well and are very cheap. Sending back today! DO NOT waste your cash on this product at all. I have got so many better quality cases from different places on Amazon then what this one.,Negative
"Snapped off the belt clip in less than a week just getting into a car.  Same problem many of these style cases have, look for metal clips instead of plastic.  This is a real problem with the Note 2 as it is big enough that it is only a matter of time before it snags on something no matter how careful you are.  And if the clip is cheap and weak, your phone is going to the floor and your holster is now worthless as the clip snaps off.",Negative
It was in the case and on my belt and the phone slid right out and busted on the pavement. Get yourself a real caste.,Negative

Looks good but dont trust your phone in this. My phone fell out the first day in this case. should have a clip on top to keep the phone from sliding out. gave it two stars for looks but functionality........ it sucks.,Negative
"It was cheap but the clip broke in less than a week. The very first day, the clip/kickstand popped off. Just clipping it to my belt, the natural movement of going about my day would pop the clip off the case and the phone would hit the ground. After a few days of the clip popping off, and me putting it back on, the plastic that held the clip on broke. I definitely wouldn't recommend this.",Negative
"I received this on the 7th, it broke on the 10th. I didn't hit it on anything or catch it on anything. Stay away from this it is cheaply made garbage.",Negative
"This case would be OK if it fit. None of the holes line up, camera slot, stylis port etc. I will gladly accept another holster that fit correctly. Because this phone is so large I need a belt clip.",Negative
The holster does not hold my husbands phone. As soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out. This makes him have to clip the case/holster inside his pocket instead of outside....which makes the holster pointless!,Negative
"I bought three different TPU cases for the LG G2. This case simply does not fit. The top and bottom of the will not stay tight against the phone and bulges. Also, this case does not form fit to the nice curved sides of the phone.",Negative
"I love the fit and feel of this case for my s4.  However, it is not shock as shock absorbing as I need.  I do not feel my phone is protected from even minor drops that inevitably happen with regular use of phones.  This spec quickly and was in original, sealed packaging.",Negative
Felt cheaply made. bought a different one to replace it. 2 stars because the kickstand was functional. There are better cases for the money or a little bit more,Negative
I bought this because of all the positive 5 star reviews. This case is nice and slim and is cheap. The big problem is it makes using the phone so much harder. A normal press of the buttons does nothing. You have to push really hard. I guess all the 5 star reviews have never used the phone with a case with cut outs.,Negative
This case is far from what I expected. The kickstand is awkwardly placed and it doesn't feel very comfortable when holding it. In addition the case is really thin. I wish I never hit the confirm purchase button.,Negative
I didn't feel that this was a very sturdy product. It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone.,Negative
ordered my case 9 days ago..it should have arrived yesterday. there is no tracking but they give me a tracking number.....wheres my case.. you charged my card but no product..,Negative
"This review is for the BoxWave case with stand. The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing! I could understand if the &#8220;Size&#8221; option was for different models of phones, but to have be different CASES is just misleading, and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case&#8230; I bought this because it was one of the &#8220;Best Cases&#8221; for the s4 as per Cnet. I don&#8217;t know what the deal is, however this case is pure garbage! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered! As a result, I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line. The cutout for the camera is the same way. For normal pictures, it is OK as it case does not block the lens, however it does partially cover the flash. As a result, you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless. There is nothing to lock it in place, so the phone falls over unless you balance it &#8220;just right.&#8221; Even then, once you tap the screen (ie: skip a You Tube add), the phone falls over. Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $4 for this case, and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $4 case. I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case. Other cases on this listing &#8220;might&#8221; be a better quality case, however, I would not hold my breath. To be honest, the cheap quality of the case I received, and the deceptive nature of the listing, I WILL NOT buy another BoxWave case.",Negative
"Ordered this to cover and protect my new SGS4. It covers the phone, but the holes for the mics dont line up centered over the holes and the buttons are nearly impossible to push (you really have to reef on them).",Negative
Did NOT fit correctly for my Samsung S4 (AT&T). I guess I got what I paid for. Be careful if you're particular about your case and want it to fit snug on your phone. This case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides. I gave this case away or else it would've just collected dust in my drawer. I would not recommend this case to anyone!,Negative
I thought this item was clear but it had a grey hue. After a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty. I would not buy this color again.,Negative
This case was okay... The rubbed edge is nifty but then the plastic was just thin and the kickstand is just poorly made... not to mention it's very hard to pull the kickstand out.,Negative
"Shows up totally deformed (top of the case doesn't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked), and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement? I don't want a replacement anymore, I want a functional phone case. Definitely a &#34;get what you pay for&#34; kind of thing. The case is pretty inflexible, so when I took the case off, it also pulled off the back of the phone. Not the end of the world, but definitely a crappy case. Would absolutely not recommend.",Negative
Don't buy this cheap ugly product! Worst mistake in buying a case for my phone. EEW! Never Again! NO! NO!,Negative
"I bought this case because it was very cheap.  I should have known it was not worth it.  The case fit is too tight.  When I put it on my phone, the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven.  No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again, the lip was just uneven.  This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case.  It was much more of a pain than a help.  Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache.",Negative
I didn't like this case to hard to put on the phone. I struggled wit getting it on. Imagine getting it off. Did not like,Negative
"This case does look good and it is comfortable to hold, but for 16.95 it should be better. The cut outs fit well enough, but the buttons are much harder to press when the case is on.I feel that for this price it should be significantly better than my 3 dollar no name TPU case i bought on Amazon.  It is not, so why spend more money for nothing special. If you are going to spend this type of money, you better get something for it.Go and check the Ballistic SG caseBallistic SG0867-M385 Soft Gel Case for Samsung Galaxy Note - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black Silicone/Black TPU/White PCfor the Galaxy Note to see what a proper case should be like; or just get that cheapo TPU case.Boxwave is just fleecing customers with this overpriced case.",Negative
"I bought two, but they sent three; took 4 weeks to get in mail, as they'd warned when purchasing; wrapped up to look like OEM, but I'm thinking it's a fake; people selling it certainly haven't responded to my complaints;  works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs.  Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one.",Negative
"I bought this battery several years ago for my RAZR V3, as the battery was about shot in it, and I shoulda just saved my money. This was not worth the time, effort or money. It wouldn't hold a charge for longer than an hour. Probably not a relevant review today, but still not worth your money",Negative
"Extremely disappointed in this product. It isn't the sellers fault, but the Razor can't hold a charge longer than 35 minutes.I bought this battery in expectance that maybe it would be better. I was totally wrong. Thankfully I bought a new phone.Don't waste you're time buying a new battery,instead save up and buy a new phone! Trust me I did.",Negative
Don't wast your money on this battery china made won't hold charge. I bougth 2 end up throwing it away.,Negative
"This is the 3rd ""OEM"" battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others, it was terrible. I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50. They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time. It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge. Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery --- not OEM. How can you tell? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan. These say clearly that they are made in china. I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues. There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk, counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it. For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time. My time is worth more than th $10 I get ripped off for. But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers. AMAZON's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth. Well AMAZON, you can start here: Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders,Wireless Phone Accessories and nowThe OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit. So it has nothing to do with the price paid. Just dishonest online sellers.",Negative
"This is the second one they sent me, both are complete trash. After 1 or 2 charge cycles it dies within 5 minutes when fully charged. DO NOT BUY",Negative
"This product (version 4.0) works with my V3 and V3x.  It does NOT work with my new V3e.I am using the overpriced Version 4.0 disc purchased directly from Motorola.Software updates still do not recognized the V3e.  Not sure which models listed work and which don't, but the fact that non-supported models seem to be listed is sufficient to be skeptical and go elsewhere.  Yeah, and it's a penny, PLUS a lot in shipping!So, if the software works for you, it is pretty nice.  If not, you're out.  I gave a review of one star based on the fact that a model I KNOW doesn't work is in the supported list.",Negative
"Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product, I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really didn't work out.Here's the summary: I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location: inside, outside, 10 feet high, 20 feet high, near a window, in the attic.  I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible, with as much vertical separation as possible.  I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked.  I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower.  I decided I didn't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work, so I returned it instead.Now the detail.  I did quite a bit of background work.  I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around.  My house is a single-story wood frame; no big buildings around and no hills.  There are 3 AT&T; cell towers within 0.85 miles (I found them and measured distance).  The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers, and apparently their power is adjusted so that they don't overlap a great deal.  In other words, I get three sets of signals, none particularly strong, and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random.  So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal, and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna, in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly.  It will simply repeat that mixed up signal.  Furthermore, the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal, which happens every once in a while.  So it is easy to see what is happening.  The repeater cannot help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting  boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal.  The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better, just ""different"" -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without, but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away.  Beyond that, I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower.  This would potentially solve these issues: the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength (I think).  However, I'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510.  I will want to look at other options (all of which, BTW, are substantially more expensive, but generally the companies offering them have longer track records).The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single, dominant cell tower nearby.  In my case, with multiple equal-strength towers (but at marginal strength), it did not help at all.  Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation, it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are.  The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work.  RF just isn't like that.Thanks to Amazon, returning it was easy.",Negative
"Got two of these headsets because of high reviews.Used both headsets on PS3, had a lot of troubles getting it to work correctly and sync with the console.The audio seems a to have some static and the mic doesnt transfer you voice clearly.I bet there are better options. Maybe these arent the real Jabra headsets?",Negative
"I am a first-time Bluetooth user.  I guess I must have ears a lot larger than the people for which this product was designed.  It does not fit me, and therefore it is unusable.So, my recommendation is that you try before you buy.",Negative
"The shape of the hard plastic ear hook was designed to cause pain - note the 2 hard plastic jagged corners turned towards your ear while the rounded portion faces up and away from any skin that it could interfere with harming.My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a ""hands free"" headset.The price is good and if you wear it in silent places where you stand a chance of hearing through it then it's almost usable but I've gotten Motorola 500 headsets for about the same price on Amazon and they work much better and are comfortable as opposed to painful.",Negative
A bit tough to put on. Thick is great for durability but makes it impossible to use with case and have no bubbles. looks great on until it gets used the. Smudges and scratches are all you notice plus not easy to see In bright conditions,Negative
"These things may work decently, but the reason for using them is completely awful. Oh, and after about 2 weeks, I could only hear static through the headset while speaking, which would not happen when I used the same headset with my computer",Negative
Worst item I've ever purchased.  Brand new batteries wont' even fully charge my phone once.  Don't buy it.  The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it doesn't work worth a darn.,Negative
"While this product does charge our BB 8703e it does so in a flaky way.  You need to insert/remove the plug several times before the unit will start charging.Also, it would seem that if you leave the batteries in the unit while not charging they get drained over time.All in all a good idea that was not executed correctly.",Negative
"I wanted to use rechargeables (good performance and inexpensive) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.That was the theory.  if you use anything other than lithium (very expensive) or alkaline (Poor performance) the positive contact will not touch. (I tried 6 different brands of rechargeables)I ended up taking it apart (disassembly is fairly easy) to put a solder blob on the positive terminal.  Now it makes contact with my NiMH batteries but the battery cover on this thing is really flimsy.  Add to that the blinking blue light - certainly gets your attention but it ends up being VERY annoying.  I tried to charge my Moto Q in my car (while using a BT headset) and I had to cover the charger with my coat.I ended up buying a noname made in China charger for less than half the price, it has a screw on battery cover and a red LED rather than these super bright blinking blue ones.  And of course, it accepted rechargables with no modifications.Basically there are better designed products out there for a lot less.",Negative
"This is the best bluetooth headset I've owned in terms of comfort and sound quality. The microphone seemed to be fine.The ear pieces are unfortunately attached to the head band via thin plastic. In my case, I experienced structural failure after 14 months of light usage.If you're going to spend more than $100 on headphones, buy something that is more stout than this particular model.",Negative
"I originally had the black wep, which worked fine.  I upgraded to the red sync from cingular and wanted the red wep.  Everyone I spoke to told me I sounded like I was in a tunnel, could never hear me, which wasn't an overall good experience.  Cute in color, small and useful, but no one could hear me clearly when I was on it.",Negative

"Tried this speaker for a few weeks in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me over the background noise.  I tried eliminating or reducing the noise in my car (radio, A/C fan, ect) but nothing seemed to work even if the speaker was attached to the drivers' visor.",Negative
AVOID AVOID AVOID.  Will not hold a charge.  A useless piece of junk.  Get something better made. Not this POS.,Negative
"I have owned this speaker for a few years now.Here's what I like about this device:* Relatively low cost* very compact. smaller than a credit card - I take it with me when I travel in case my rental car won't have BT* speaker quality is acceptable* very simple* turns off automatically if phone is out of range for a while* long battery life* uses standard USB for charging* easy to pair, but you will have to be just a little 'techy'.Here's what I don't like:* inconsistent quality. Sometimes I get complaints from people saying they can't hear me. sometimes it works fine though. Bottom line is I cannot trust it for important calls.* the blue blinking light is very annoying at night and to my best knowledge cannot be disabled* need to remember to turn the device on when you get into the car. However, connection is established pretty quickly.I still use this device, mainly to use with my phone as a navigation device. I also make calls sometimes but I can't really trust this device for important calls so I would not recommend this device overall. It's OK, but I would pay more to get better (and more consistent) sound quality.",Negative
"I do a lot of freeway driving and I've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor. It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise. Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone. The phone thinks it's still connected to the speaker phone,it will show that it's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off.",Negative
"We bought two of these based on reviews. Wife didn't like hers at all. Mine on voice dialing recognized every word but the Yes command that actually would initiate the call. So, no voice dialing. People on the other end reported they could not understand me. We returned them.",Negative
"The first one I got stopped working in about a month later, so Motorola replaced me with supposedly a newer one. New one continues to work but- person on the other side cannot hear correctly- lots of static like noises even when fully chargedFor the excellent customer service, I should give 5 stars to Motorola and 1 (or 0) star to this particular product.Update: After this, I tried Plantronics voyager 510 as a BT earpiece. This also had issues (while better than this Motorola T305), and so I gave up on bluetooth and went for wired in-ear Sennheiser headphones",Negative
"It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone, but no driver for it.  The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone. Go through live Internet update to version 4.35, still no driver for it.  Tried Motorola web site, there is no driver download for this phone. Contacted Motorol support, they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone.  Called that number and opened case with them.  Three days later, on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours, still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services, then sync the phonebook that way.  We are not ready to pay Verizon $50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age, you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download.  Not with Motorola.  I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola, so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver....",Negative
These are not good for long term. The phone gets really warm when charging. Instead go with the original chargers. If u can spend 200-300 USD for a phone u can afford an original charger. I stopped using these after couple times.,Negative
"This charger was one of the cheapest, but wasn't worth the savings.  In less than a month the product stopped working and upon examination it was clearly fried!  Even the outer plastic looked as though it was melting.  Definitely not worth it.",Negative

"The holster looks nice, seems to be well made and has a strong clip but it's so tight that when I put the phone in it presses all the buttons on the way in causing all sorts of unwanted things to happen. I have to put the phone in upside down to keep that from happening. When I do it that way it works just fine. Weird.",Negative
Still waiting on this product since I ordered it on January 1 2010 (3-5 days shipping),Negative
"I bought these today at WalMart, and they are terrible. After cutting with a paper trimmer, they were perfect size. Although after VERY careful and slow application, rolling on just a cm at a time, air bubbles would form. I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth. After application, and only rubbing the protector with microfiber, it was scratched past the point of no return. I cannot imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen, after a couple of days use you probably won't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches. The users guide says for best results to replace monthly. After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money.",Negative
"use on 2cameras and cell phone.  The cutting is fairly straight forward, but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing.  material not durable at all.  Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package.  Lastly, if you had to reposition it, good luck getting the bubbles (hazyness) out.  Requires too much effort to get it right.  Would not recommand it.",Negative

They said it was universal mount but it did not fit my Samsung Galaxy 3! I returned it and don't believe I ever received my credit.,Negative
"I bought this for my Samsung S2 expecting somewhat of a snug fit (I don't have a case). It fit for the first few weeks, and then the left vent clip decided to snap, along with the adjustable arm. on top of all these issues, the padding was next to useless. Getting a suction cup holder next.",Negative
"I've been impressed by the windshield lock-grip of Garmin Nuvi units and even by the effectiveness of a 9-dollar silly-looking gooseneck that not only held my iPod in place but charged it and served as reliable FM transmitter to boot. This latter item item didn't score well with other Amazon customers--proof that you can't always trust the ratings.In the case of this ""Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder,"" you can trust the consumer ratings--in fact, they may even be a bit high. The device is branded as a ""Cellet"" universal mount in the title, but in the description it's referred to as a ""Luxmo"" universal mount.  No matter. A poorly designed piece of plastic is--by any name--a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can, if you choose, unscrew the base and toss it so that it's not in the way of the bracket, which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient ""vent.""  Unfortunately, my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket, or ""Vent Mount (non)solution.""  So it was on to Plan B, the ""Dash Mount"" solution (at least it's a versatile little fellow).  But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch.  Moreover, I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try.  So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation: it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot!Here's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte--i.e. making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better.  In other words, I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this ""adjustable"" guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised.  Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo's right arm, nothing happened.  His right arm was jammed (and the left is clearly non-adjustable).  Since he obviously needed a helping hand, I gave him one.  Unfortunately, my gentle tugging  pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the (non) ""Adjustable Grip.""Mercifully, the experience came to an end before I'd given this low-(but over)priced imposter a chance to show its stuff.  But even more fortunately, I can now put this review to rest.  May the next buyer have a happier story to tell.  As for me, I'm back to my original clunky and unsightly but effective mount with the gooseneck:GSI Super Quality Wireless Hands-Free 5-in-1 Dock-Mount-Charger-FM Transmitter-Car Kit, with Goose-neck Mount for Ipod, IPhone 4-3G-3GS, MP3, MP4, CD, DVD Players - Includes Remote Control, Audio Cable, LCD Display - Cigarette Lighter Plug-In.",Negative
It was kinda too small for my phone the advertisement said that it fit the GS3 even after I took the case off it still didn't fit and one of the holders completely broke off! If you have a GS3 don't buy this it's trash,Negative
"I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield.  I discovered 2 things:1) The unit itself is very cheap.  The adjustable arm used to clamp your phone has a major weak spot.  Mine broke right out of the package.  I made some repairs to strengthen it, but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones.  I have an iPhone, and it's too wide and tall for this device.  You can't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design, and the bottom ledge is too small.  After 5 minutes of driving, I had to remove my phone before it fell out.This is a good idea that was implemented poorly.",Negative
"This mount is actually great for the first two days. I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it, it would start moving to the sides when I turned. I would have to readjust every time. I used it on a GalaxySII, it was very tight fitting. So DO NOT BUY.",Negative
I'm not very impressed with this.  It's super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent.  It wiggles around and looks bad as well.  I would not recommend.,Negative
Terrible Unit. magnet not strong enough for Iphone 4s. Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing.,Negative
It is too tiny for holding a phone. The metal plate is also too tiny and thick to put between phone and case. Don't even bother to think about this product.,Negative
"Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work, and I have to agree with them.  Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars!  If you search the internet, you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception, block radio waves from frying your brain, etc.  It doesn't work and it's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone.  If you phone doesn't have such a connection, then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work, and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception (there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews).I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn.  If so, please just send it to my PayPal account instead.",Negative
"Had zero effect. My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference. Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio, and almost none inside (I live in a concrete apartment). If I put the phone in the same place I had this, I get good reception, but this didn't extend my signal any, or act as a repeater. Didn't seem to help in the car either, but I don't really need it there.",Negative
Does nothing. Did not and any noticeable change. I have used it for some time.  The only time it does anything is if it's on your phone.,Negative
"There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car.  These areas are very small, only about 300 feet long.  And if I hold the phone outside the car when I drive through these areas, the calls don't drop.I bought this device with the hope that it would allow me to keep calls going without rolling down the windows.  Unfortunately, I found absolutely NO difference between calls being dropped with and without this device.When I took the device off, it broke open and I took both sides apart.  I didn't find any evidence of components that will inductively couple the antenna and the interior components.However, when it was installed, it did **look** impressive.  So, if you want a fake cellular antenna to make your car look ""cool,"" this will fit the bill perfectly.  If you want a performance improvement, consider one of the Wilson cellular repeaters instead.",Negative

"Bought this because I recently got an LG Octane cell that I love except for the 2.5mm headset plug.  I use a wired headset with a boom mic at work due to background noise causing too much interference with the mic on my Bluetooth headset.  Headset has 3.5mm plug.  Bought this to use the headset with the LG.  While I can hear the caller with both ears, the MIC does not work!  I had another adaptor I had used with an earlier LG, and it had the same problem, but hoped this would work based on the (admittedly vague) description and a review specifically stating it worked with the Octane.  Apparently, that reviewer only wanted it for music, even though that's not what he stated.  Anyway, the same headset worked fine in a Motorola Droid RAZR with a built in 3.5mm jack.  I knew this was a crapshoot.  I lost.  Hope to keep others from repeating my mistake.Also, the adaptor I got is white- the pictures of it vary depending on how you search for it, and change from the item description to the picture in your shopping cart.  This is a pretty sketchy listing for Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was getting, and didn't get what I expected.  Oh, well.  Only $3 wasted.",Negative
"Thought my headset for my computer which has a 3.5mm plug would be able to be used by plugging into this converter cable which then would fit my ATT 2 Line office phone. It does not. The price is so low, it would cost me more to send it back than it cost to buy. Bad purchase.",Negative
